References for this speech can be found on the US Federal Reserve Systems's website. I am honored to participate in this tribute to Otmar Issing. I have known and admired Otmar for some time. It has been a source of great pride that he has considered me a worthy intellectual sparing partner over the years. From the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the restaurants of Frankfurt and at many conferences in between, we have challenged each other to state our assumptions, examine the evidence, and adjust our conclusions accordingly. I have derived enormous benefit from that give-and-take-a sentiment, I am sure, that many others in this room share. I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late-namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy. Otmar and I have debated this issue on many occasions, and these discussions-together with recent research carried out at the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and elsewhere-have been both challenging and stimulating. The preparation of this talk has afforded me a welcome opportunity to reexamine my thinking on this subject. So, today, I will review the arguments and the evidence as I see them and draw out the conclusions to which I am currently led. At the outset, let me stress that I will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Most fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation. But many argue that pronounced booms and busts in asset markets are another matter, especially if actual valuations appear to be misaligned with fundamentals. What should a central bank do when it suspects it faces a major speculative event-one that might be large enough to threaten economic stability when it unwinds? To help frame the discussion, I will focus on two different strategies that have been proposed for dealing with market bubbles. The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy-calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years. Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term. Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process. Following this strategy does not imply that policymakers ignore the expected future evolution of speculative activity. If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations. Practically speaking, however, I view our ability to act on such suspicions as limited given how little we know about the dynamics of speculative episodes. Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices-indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation. It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings. The second strategy, by comparison, is more activist and attempts to damp speculative activity directly. It was described at length in \\\"Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy,\\\" an article published by the ECB last year. I quote from the article: \\\"This approach amounts to a cautious policy of 'leaning against the wind' of an incipient bubble. The central bank would adopt a somewhat tighter policy stance in the face of an inflating asset market than it would otherwise allow if confronted with a similar macroeconomic outlook under more normal market conditions. . . . It would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future.\\\" Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble. Thus, the strategy seeks to trade off the near-certainty of worse macroeconomic performance today for the chance of disproportionally better performance in the future, on the theory that the repercussions of a major market correction could be highly nonlinear. But the extra-action proposal is by no means a bold call for central banks to prick market bubbles. As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession. Rather, the extra-action strategy is intended only to provide some limited insurance against the possibility of highly adverse events occurring down the road. I will be talking at length about the differences between the two strategies, but I must stress up front how much they have in common. Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework. Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies. At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level. Of course, we may not be prepared to write down a specific loss function and say, \\\"There, that's what I'm minimizing.\\\" But our deliberative processes and our actions seem broadly consistent with that characterization of the general problem. This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area. Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well. We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is marketdetermined and easily liquified. Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending. Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services. Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending. In cases of sharply falling market valuations, these adverse credit-channel effects may even be exacerbated by the deteriorating health of banks and other financial institutions. In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time. Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts. In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass. While no one uses formal Bayesian methods to solve this difficult problem, I think most policymakers do engage in at least an informal weighing of the various possibilities and their implications when setting policy. Now let me turn from areas of agreement to more contentious issues, ones that have a strong bearing on the relative merits of the two strategies. As the ECB article notes, extra action is often seen as a type of insurance. And as with any insurance policy, before you buy you have to ask whether the expected benefits outweigh the costs. As I see it, extra action pays only if three tough conditions are met. First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, there must be a fairly high probability that a modestly tighter policy will help to check the further expansion of speculative activity. And finally, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from a less expansive bubble must be sizable. You may be thinking that, in stating the three conditions, I have slanted the case with such phrases as \\\"reasonable confidence\\\" and \\\"fairly high probability.\\\" But stick with me, and I hope to persuade you that these probabilistic qualifiers are needed to judge the merits of extra action. For the moment, let me set aside the first condition and assume that central banks can distinguish an emerging bubble from improving fundamentals at an early stage. What about the other two conditions? Should we presume that a limited application of restrictive policy would materially restrain the speculative boom and make its eventual unwinding less disruptive for the overall economy? Consider the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-to-late 1990s. The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits-fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices. How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future. In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals. But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies. At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects. In general, we have a very poor understanding of the forces driving speculative bubbles and the role played by monetary policy. In fact, we cannot rule out perverse effects. Again, consider the U.S. experience of the late 1990s. When the FOMC tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell-perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained. Since mid-2004, we have seen a marked decline in bond-term premiums, even as the funds rate has risen steadily. These episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction. However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble. Even then, with the second condition now met, the third condition might not hold: The expected improvement in future macroeconomic performance from moderating the bubble's expansion may not be enough to more than offset the upfront costs of extra action. To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future. Admittedly, if the worst-outcome scenario associated with an unchecked bubble is judged sufficiently dire and if the scenario is not seen as too improbable, then a risk-averse policymaker might regard the expected return from extra action insurance as worth its upfront cost. However, our confidence in such an assessment would seem to hinge on believing that the effects of market corrections could be markedly nonlinear. Proponents of extra action often cite an increased risk of severe financial distress as a potential source of such effects. However, without the onset of deflation, how large is this risk? In recent history, the health of the U.S. financial system remained solid after the collapse of the high-tech boom, despite the bankruptcy of dozens of telecom and dot-com firms, the loss of more than $\\\\$ 8$ trillion in stock market wealth, and stress in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Moreover, the financial sectors of most other developed economies also weathered the worldwide drop in corporate equity values fairly well. Of course, the nonlinear risks associated with a collapsing bubble may depend on the initial health of the financial system, and under some circumstances we could be worried about the potential for significant financial distress to accompany the bursting of a bubble, should that bubble expand further. Even in such cases, however, I wonder whether good prudential supervision in advance and prompt action to clean up any lingering structural problems afterward would not be better ways to deal with this possibility. Certainly, closer oversight of banking systems during the 1980s, including the United States, would have left many economies in a stronger position during the early 1990s. This lesson has been absorbed by supervisory authorities around the world, as evidenced by our successful efforts to strengthen bank capital and our financial systems. I do agree that market corrections can have profoundly adverse consequences if they lead to deflation, as illustrated by the United States after the 1929 stock market crash and the more recent experience of Japan. But it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses. In Japan, deflation could probably have been avoided if the initial monetary response to the slump in real estate and stock market values had been more aggressive; in addition, macroeconomic performance would have been better if the government had dealt more promptly with the structural problems of the banking sector. As for the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve actually worsened the situation by allowing the money supply to contract sharply in 1930 and 1931, after unwisely attempting to prick the stock market bubble in the first place. Rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound. By doing so, policymakers should be able to avoid the severe nonlinear dynamics of deflation. Proponents of extra action often argue that it should reduce the risk of hitting the zero bound, but we should recognize that under some circumstances extra action may actually exacerbate the problem. To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts. Now the central bank contemplates taking extra action. In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small. In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand. With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts. Under these conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expected economic performance, not improve it. Another purported benefit of extra action is that, by raising the cost of capital to firms and households, it helps reduce overinvestment fostered during speculative booms, thereby making it easier for the economy to recover after the bubble collapses. However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the macroeconomic importance of such capital mis-allocation. True, the U.S. high-tech boom led to overinvestment in some sectors, wasting resources and creating lingering difficulties while capital overhangs were eliminated. But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years. Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals. Thus, mitigating capital misallocation in one sector would have created capital misallocations elsewhere, making the assessment of the net gain from extra action difficult. And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation. Now I would like to return to the first condition, the one I sidestepped a few minutes ago--the question of identifying market bubbles in a timely fashion. The EOB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate. For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain. Under extra action, mistakenly identifying a bubble has significant costs. By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose. Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses. But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time. And the mistaken call would have reduced welfare by needlessly inducing fluctuations in the macroeconomy. Timing is also an issue. Let us suppose that the evidence is so compelling that policymakers become fairly confident that valuations are excessively rich. Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability. The market correction could occur with policy in a tighter position but before extra action had enough time to materially influence speculative activity. Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits. Such talk might do some good by prompting investors to stop and rethink their assumptions. And talk by itself should not do much lasting harm even if valuations turn out to be justified--provided, however, that words are not seen as precursors to action under circumstances in which conventional policy would still be the best approach. To wrap up this critique, I summarize as follows: If we can identify bubbles quickly and accurately, are reasonably confident that tighter policy would materially check their expansion, and believe that severe market corrections have significant non-linear adverse effects on the economy, then extra action may well be merited. But if even one of these tough conditions is not met, then extra action would be more likely to lead to worse macroeconomic performance over time than that achievable with conventional policies that deal expeditiously with the effects of the unwinding of the bubbles when they occur. For my part, I am dubious that any central banker knows enough about the economy to overcome these hurdles. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances, or perhaps at some point in the future when our understanding of asset markets and the economy has increased, such a course of action would be appropriate. Proponents of extra action have their own bones to pick with the conventional strategy, especially as it relates to the alleged asymmetric nature of the policy's response to asset market booms and busts. In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC's actions over the past twenty years, the Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems. This argument strikes me as a misreading of history. U.S. monetary policy has responded symmetrically to the implications of asset-price movements for actual and projected developments in output and inflation, consistent with its mandate. The most convincing evidence for this statement can be found in the results: Interest rates have been consistent with underlying inflation remaining reasonably stable for some time now, accompanied by relatively mild fluctuations in real activity. Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk. Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a \\\"Greenspan put,\\\" stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy. Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were. The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions. Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves. Ironically, one can argue that extra action may pose a more significant risk of moral hazard. It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some \\\"appropriate\\\" level. How does this strategy play out if a central bank takes extra action and speculative activity continues unabated or even intensifies? Do policymakers raise rates even further above levels consistent with conventional policy and, if so, at what consequences for the economy? And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices? If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase? My remarks today have been intended as a salute to Otmar and to all the valuable contributions he has made over the years to my thinking and to that of policymakers around the world. Otmar, you have taught me much about intellectual rigor in support of central bank contributions to economic welfareand about friendship. Weighing the relative merits of extra action and conventional policy is not easy and requires a nuanced interpretation of the arguments and the evidence, as well as some hard thinking. Otmar and his colleagues have done this in advancing the case for extra action, and by so doing they have given me a good intellectual workout--and Otmar, I thank you for that. I hope my response has provided a good workout in return. I look forward to continuing the debate and especially the friendship for many years to come.\",\n          \"Interview with Mr Beno\\u00eet Coeur\\u00e9, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Delo, conducted by Mr Miha Jenko and published on 15 February 2014. Beno\\u00eet C\\u0153ur\\u00e9: Over the last 16 months, Slovenia has been through a very difficult period, with many serious challenges both from an economic and also from a financial standpoint. The Slovenian authorities have acknowledged and understood the challenges and have been addressing them in a systematic and serious way. The first appropriate and important steps have been taken, in particular when it comes to the restructuring of the banking sector. By completing the asset quality review and the stress tests they have reached a milestone, allowing for the restructuring of the banking system. But there remains a lot to be done. Both the Slovenian government and Banka Slovenije have a very good understanding of what has to be done. This relates to three key issues. The first is financial sector restructuring. This is well advanced. The asset quality review and the stress tests have been important and have been done in a serious and professional way, but this is only the first step. From now on you need a comprehensive reform of the banking system as part of a broader strategy for the entire economy. In this respect there are quite a few further steps to be taken. Second, there is the fiscal dimension, where you need to bring down the fiscal deficit, but it is also very important to bring down the public debt. In this respect, Slovenia must observe the recommendations issued by the European Commission regarding the reduction of the structural deficit. This fiscal effort should be aimed towards a visible reduction in the debt level. And the third aspect is obviously economic reform and improving the efficiency of the economy. No other effort will be successful if the economy does not become more efficient. Yes, the IMF has also warned Slovenia in its latest report about the risk of rapidly increasing public debt which could soon go beyond the hard-to-manage level of 85\\\\%. What are the necessary steps to reduce this risk of unmanageable public debt and high interest rate costs? One of the key policy actions is privatisation, which can be very useful both to improve the efficiency of the companies and banks and also to reduce Slovenia's debt level. Slovenian banks were subject recently to a very strict and a very conservative review by auditing companies Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman. In the end, there was the impression that we are forced to apply the most extreme, the most pessimistic and the most costly scenario as calculated by Oliver Wyman. Do you agree? I don't want to pass a judgement on the stress test itself which was done by the Slovenian authorities. In principle we are in favour of a strict approach to the stress tests. It is important to be on the safe side, to be prepared for the future and it is important that the banks are sound again so that they can lend to companies. So recapitalising banks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment in the future, so that banks can extend new loans to the economy. Slovenia has to address its banking legacy issues and be on the safe side. Are you also going to support such a strict, conservative approach this year when 128 key European banks will be analysed? Are these banks going to be examined as rigorously as ours? Absolutely, it will be the same philosophy. We will discuss all the parameters with the 18 supervisors - the so-called \\\"national competent authorities\\\" of the 18 euro area countries - within the ECB's new Supervisory Board, which met for the first time on 30 January. This will be the place where all the assumptions, parameters and choices will be discussed. This will be the first important contribution made by the Single Supervisory Mechanism to the euro area. The principles will be the same and they will be very strict, to make sure that we know everything about the situation of the banks this time - and to be sure that measures are taken to prepare for the future. Several critical reviews of the Oliver Wyman financial consultancy appeared recently in the foreign press. Why has the ECB decided to use Oliver Wyman, of all companies, to carry out such a demanding task and what were the selection criteria? There was an open, competitive selection process and Oliver Wyman came first. Taxpayers in Slovenia have paid over $\\u20ac 3$ billion, nearly 9\\\\% of GDP, for the recapitalisation of troubled state-owned banks alone. Banks are now full of capital. But on the other hand they are not lending money to companies for their working capital and investments. How do you see this controversy? Part of the explanation has to do with the weakness of aggregate demand not only in Slovenia but also across the euro area. Slovenia is a very open economy, selling a lot to European markets. The overall weakness of growth in the euro area also weighs on Slovenia. Now, it is true that the low level of ECB rates today translates very slowly to the real economy. This is happening in many countries and it is not specific to Slovenia. It will improve over time as we see convergence in the euro area and as we see reforms being implemented in the countries. And this you can already see taking place in Slovenia in the decrease in yields on the sovereign bond market. There has been a significant improvement in the long-term interest rates on bond markets. Slovenia is one of the best performers in the euro area in terms of decreasing bond yields, so that's a sign that convergence is taking place. It takes time to feed into the real economy but it will happen; things are going in the right direction. I think the priority currently is not really the Keynesian one. In Slovenia, the priority is to make the economy more efficient, both in the private sector and in the public sector. This also means that some companies should be moved from the public sector to the private sector through privatisation. This will happen and it will also benefit the debt level. Some enterprises will remain in the public sector - but their efficiency must also be improved. All the efforts that are being made today by the government and by Banka Slovenije to restore the soundness of the banking system are not going to achieve their goals, meaning to support growth and employment, if the economy does not work better. It is good to inject capital into banks, but if banks are facing projects that are not profitable they will be creating bad loans and make losses and the capital will be burnt. So it is very important that, alongside the restructuring and recapitalisation of banks, efforts are made to restructure the economy and to make it more profitable. That is also the recommendation of the European Commission to all countries and in particular to Slovenia in the so-called Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. It is important that this is respected. Haircutting the subordinated debt in Slovenian banks attracted a lot of public attention and even anger in recent months in Slovenia. Why was it necessary to perform this haircut in Slovenia, but not, for instance, in Ireland or other countries? This is not specific to Slovenia. Europe has learned the lessons from the past crises and has adopted a principle of responsibility for investors in bank bonds. All investors who put their money in these bonds have to know that they will be part of the effort if anything bad happens because bonds are an investment, not a deposit. These are the bail-in rules that have been decided by the European authorities and are intended to protect taxpayers, who should not be responsible for the situation of banks. When saving a bank, taxpayers should come last, with shareholders coming first, followed by bond owners. This distribution of responsibilities is now clear. This is not a decision of the ECB, it is a decision of the European Council and the Commission, but one that we support. True, but the decision is very recent and people didn't know before that something like that could happen at all. Slovenia is not the first case. It has already happened in Spain, for instance. But it's a change in the regime, with the aim that taxpayers and depositors are better protected and are not liable for the errors committed by banks. The BAMC had a good start. It has built up expertise and human capital, started operating and has already been receiving a first batch of bad loans. It now needs to continue its work and to receive the next instalment of bad assets, subject to the authorisation by the European Commission. Secondly, it needs to continue building up the institution itself so that it is credible and independent. It is not only about restructuring the banking sector but also about making the Slovenian economy function better. Bad loans are loans to the economy. For this reason, the BAMC should take decisions that are in the interest of Slovenian taxpayers and of the Slovenian people. It should keep resisting vested interests. For this purpose it has to be independent and in this way it will best protect the interests of taxpayers and workers in Slovenia. The good news is that Moody's has just increased the ratings of the recently recapitalised Slovenian banks. What should be done now by these banks to ensure further improvement of their ratings so that they can improve their access to funding and extend loans on favourable conditions? Beyond the ratings, what matters for Slovenia is the renewed trust of financial markets and investors, and the ultimate goal would be for these banks to be able to diversify their funding sources in the market, which would make them more resilient, and in turn support the Slovenian economy. Their objective should be to access to stable funding in financial markets. Banks should now properly manage their loan books and make adequate provisions, if necessary. But ultimately what matters most will be profitable projects in the economy. And this does not depend so much on the banks but also on the government, which needs to ensure a more efficient public sector, and on reforming the economy so that it is more efficient and able to thrive in the European environment. The key to success, therefore, lies in the real economy, not in the financial sector. I agree. Slovenia's economy generates nearly 70\\\\% of GDP from exports. What is the ECB's assessment of our main trading partners, Germany, France, Austria and Italy? Could we expect more demand from these countries this year? Certainly demand in the largest European economies is steadily improving. This is obviously not enough, but growth is positive again and it is accelerating. All the recent signs from the economy across Europe suggest that this scenario is again taking place. It is a scenario of a slow but steadily improving growth, also in the larger European economies. So demand from these economies is picking up and improving, and should benefit smaller, very open economies such as Slovenia. So there is ground for optimism. The euro area is going in the right direction. Two years ago, maybe even one year ago we didn't have this direction, this steady and improving growth. Certainly it is not enough and everything should be done to prop it up - but it is very important to know what the direction is. So is the euro safe now after some very turbulent years when there was even speculation it might break up? Is the euro on the safe side now, out of the worst trouble? The euro is no longer being challenged as a project. This is an important achievement. European policy-makers have confirmed their commitment to the single currency project and to the integrity of the euro area and this has restored trust in the euro in international capital markets. This is why many international investors are now coming to the euro area - it's a sign of trust in the reform process here. That's good news. What remains very challenging is growth, which is too low, and it should be Europe's priority to support it not only in countries with adjustment programmes but also in all other euro area countries. This cannot be achieved through additional public spending but through additional investment. All countries have to restore a climate of confidence that will be conducive to investment, and this includes large economies such as Germany, France and Italy. According to the latest figures, the inflation rate in the euro area has dropped as low as $0.7 \\\\%$, the lowest level in years. How serious is the problem of deflation for the ECB? The Governing Council's assumption is that the rate of inflation will gradually increase towards our target of close to, but below, $2 \\\\%$. We are however closer to the area where inflation expectations could be altered and create downside risks to price stability. So we are very vigilant regarding risks to our baseline scenario, which envisages inflation slowly going back to $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. This is our primary mandate and we take it very seriously. At its last meeting, the Governing Council firmly reiterated our forward guidance, whereby we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. We remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation that is appropriate for the euro area economy, and will not hesitate to take further decisive action if required. Inflation being below $2 \\\\%$ and close to $2 \\\\%$ is the definition of price stability that the ECB has chosen. In the uncertain environment with the euro area in transition and the participating economies undergoing a lot of structural change, it is very important that the ECB sticks to its inflation objective and maintains its credibility as an anchor for the reform efforts in Europe. The reason why the $2 \\\\%$ number has been chosen is that this is a level that is neither too high nor too low. We know that inflation which is too high can be detrimental for the economy as it can lead to destabilising feedback loops, for instance, through wage settlements and price indexation, and ultimately erode trust in the currency. But very low inflation can also be destabilising. That's why inflation which is too low is also contrary to price stability as it can create a self-fulfilling spiral of expectations that prices will continue falling. That would discourage households from consuming and companies would stop investing. This is the definition of deflation. So we want to be in the safe area between high inflation and deflation, and below but close to $2 \\\\%$ is exactly the right level. Note that since 1998, when this number was chosen, most of the major central banks around the world have converged towards the same number: it has been adopted by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and most recently by the Bank of Japan. Such steadily increasing prices do not distort economic choices. My personal definition of price stability is a rate of inflation which does not distort economic behaviour. To come back to Slovenian issues: our authorities have taken the decision to avoid using the ESM funds, which also carry certain conditionality. Based on the philosophy that we will solve our problems by ourselves, we have also tried to sell bonds in the US market. What is your view of that? Would it be better for Slovenia to return to the euro market and issue euro-denominated bonds? After all, we are a euro area country. I don't have any advice to give to your finance minister. He certainly does what is in the best interest of Slovenian taxpayers. In the medium term, stable funding for the Slovenian budget would benefit from a mix of dollar issuance and euro issuance. But so far the funding strategy has been successful. The biggest opposition party in Slovenia has proposed changes in central bank legislation to allow a representative of the political opposition to attend sessions of the Governing Board of Banka Slovenije. Is this proposal in line with ECB policies? We are in the process of looking at that particular proposal but it is clear that in every euro area country, small or large, the independence of the national central bank has to be ensured. According to one estimate, the 128 largest European banks which will undergo the asset quality review and stress test this year will require up to $\\u20ac 500$ billion of additional capital. Is this a manageable amount? It is absolutely premature to comment on any number. We are at the start of the process, getting organised and collecting the data. Once these tests have been completed, will European taxpayers be on the safe side? Will they have any guarantee that such a banking crisis will never happen again? The best safeguard to make sure that the banking crisis doesn't happen again is tough supervision, which will be ensured through the Single Supervisory Mechanism that will start operating in November. This is the best protection. The ECB, as the single supervisor in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, will have to be tough. Together with the new banking rules, this will be the best way of preventing future crises. I very much believe that taxpayers are now much better protected than they were before the crisis, in particular thanks to the new bail-in rules that make sure that investors in banks will be the first to cover any losses. If any capital shortfall is identified by the ECB stress test and asset quality review, it will have to be covered first by the private sector. The ECB has had a very clear role since May 2010, when we were invited to join the troika and advise the European Commission on matters where we have specific expertise. Those are generally financial sector issues, the situation of banks and also the general macroeconomic balance. This has been our role, but otherwise all the decisions related to financial support to countries have been taken by the Eurogroup and by the countries themselves. The Eurogroup is the politically and democratically accountable authority. Key decisions can only be taken by authorities, or politicians who are accountable to their parliaments. Decisions on reforms in individual countries can only be taken by local governments under the scrutiny of national parliaments. The work of the troika has to be accountable to democratic institutions. The ECB can explain what it does in the troika, but we only act as an adviser. The ECB is this year moving to a beautiful new building in Frankfurt. How many people will work in the new building and what will change with the move? The ECB's new building is a long-term project. All of our staff, some 1600 people, except those in charge of banking supervision, will move to the new building. The new banking supervisory body within the ECB will be located in another building in the centre of Frankfurt because its staff have to be together. It is also good that the monetary policy part of the ECB and the supervisory part are separated, as they are two different functions. The Governing Council has confirmed its main scenario of a steady recovery, with inflation gradually moving back towards our policy objective of below, but close to, $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. As explained by President Draghi, we didn't see enough reasons for policy action at our last meeting. Over the next weeks and months, if risks to our main scenario materialise, we will be ready to act, consistent with our forward guidance.\",\n          \"Speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the \\\"Annual Danish Top Executive Summit 2013\\\", Copenhagen, 29 January 2013. It is a real pleasure for me to share some thoughts today with such a distinguished group of business leaders. It may strike you as somewhat paradoxical for a central banker to address such an audience in a conference where the main theme is innovative thinking. After all, central bankers have traditionally been stereotyped as conservative and, well, rather dull. I firmly believe, though, that in a constantly changing world, decision-makers need to develop and maintain a healthy degree of scepticism around whether their current strategies and practices remain fit-for-purpose. This holds for decision-makers in business as well as in the public policy domain. And it is particularly relevant for central bankers, who have shouldered large part of the responsibility to navigate the economy through a once-in-a-generation financial and economic crisis. In the first part of my remarks today I will contour some salient features of central banks' response to the crisis. But I am sure that everyone here today is more interested in the future than pondering on what has been done so far. Indeed, as the macroeconomic and business environment remains challenging, the calls for a rethinking of business models and strategic orientations become more forceful. This is also the case in the monetary policy-making arena, where new strategic aspects are being promoted and debated around the globe. In the second and main part of my remarks I would, therefore, like to focus on two examples of such \\\"innovative\\\" strategic thinking for monetary policy, assessing them from a euro area perspective. The first example concerns the objective of monetary policy. The second one refers to how policy is conducted to deliver the assigned objective. Prompted by the crisis, central bankers globally have thought openly and creatively. They designed and deployed a host of measures that went well beyond their traditional modus operandi. This reaction of central banks has clear parallels to the way business leaders confront challenges. To illustrate this, let me briefly outline how features of central banking practices correspond to the four themes that the organisers of this conference have laid out as relevant for addressing challenges in the corporate world. The first theme is strength. Central banks typically rely on financial markets to transmit their monetary policy intentions to the real economy. During the crisis, dysfunctional segments of financial markets threatened to weaken or completely suppress this process. Central banks addressed these market dislocations in a resolute way, thereby showcasing the strength of the instruments that are at their disposal. Second comes control. Ensuring that the expectations of firms and households regarding future inflation remain well-anchored is of the essence for keeping inflation in check. During the crisis, through words and deeds, central banks have strived to maintain these expectations under control. The third theme is horizon. The most obvious concept of horizon in the context of central banking is that of time-horizon. Both in normal times and in times of crisis, central bankers seek to maintain a medium-term horizon and thus avoid being overwhelmed by short-term considerations. At the same time, central banks have demonstrated a capacity to deploy crisis management measures within a very short time span, when this was necessary. The fourth and final theme of the conference was courage. Again this may sound paradoxical. Central bankers are proverbially prudent and risk averse. But there is a particular type of courage that they need to exhibit: the courage and firm character to stay the course and unwaveringly pursue the assigned mandate, when calls to serve other objectives can be increasingly loud. At the ECB, in particular, our response to the crisis has been two-pronged. The first element has been the swift reduction of our key policy rates to historically low levels in response to the emergence of downside risks to price stability. This is what is considered \\\"standard\\\" monetary policy action. The second element has entailed a host of measures to address dislocations in financial markets that were preventing the permissive monetary policy interest rates to be fully and evenly reflected in the lending conditions faced by households and firms across the euro area. These measures are typically referred to as \\\"non-standard\\\" and were intended to relieve liquidity and funding constraints in the banking sector, as well as unwarranted tail risks. This set of measures, therefore, serves to improve financing conditions over and above what can be achieved through reductions in the key ECB interest rates. In addressing the crisis we have been acutely aware of the need to strike a delicate balance between two sets of competing considerations. On the one hand, central banks were faced with the risk of a financial meltdown, which would have had profound implications for the real economy and which posed a serious threat to price stability. On the other hand, the resolute response of the central bank to the financial crisis relieves the pressure from other actors in the economy to measure up to their own responsibilities, correct the past unsustainable economic course and unwind excesses. This refers not only to governments but also to the private sector. In the past year we have seen significant progress in the European economic governance framework. These changes to the institutional architecture of the EU have been of great importance for restoring the appropriate incentives of the actors involved. Let me now turn to the discussion of \\\"innovative\\\" ideas on strategic aspects of monetary policy. Since the early 1980s, a broad consensus has emerged across advanced economies which has elevated price stability to the main - although not always the sole - objective of monetary policy. Indeed, through the fixed-exchange-rate policy for the krone vis-\\u00e0-vis the euro, Danmarks Nationalbank is effectively also among the central banks aiming at maintaining price stability. In most cases, the mandate for pursuing price stability has been operationalised by defining a numerical value for inflation that the central bank should aim to deliver. In advanced economies this value is low, typically within a narrow range around $2 \\\\%$. In the wake of the crisis, however, a number of pundits have called for an increase in the inflation rate that central banks should aim for. These calls have originated from diverse sources spanning academia, policy circles and financial markets. Proponents of this The rationale is that a higher inflation objective, if credible, would prompt firms and households to revise their expectations regarding future inflation upwards. By doing so, it would reduce further down real interest rates, which are not necessarily constrained by zero. As real - rather than nominal - interest rates matter for economic decisions such as investment and consumption, this change should promote economic activity. It is therefore argued that switching to a higher numerical aim for inflation will bring about a one-off accommodative effect when it is adopted. Moreover, it is claimed that it will also make it less likely in the future that nominal rates will become constrained by their lower bound. It may not surprise you to hear that I am very sceptical about this proposal, both in general terms and in the euro area context in particular. To explain my concerns, I shall step back for a moment and clarify an aspect of the ECB's monetary policy framework that is subtle, but in my view important. By contrast to many central banks around the world, the ECB does not practice inflation targeting. The ECB has been mandated by the Treaty (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) to maintain price stability over the medium term. The mandate itself does not entail a precise definition of what price stability means in practice. The Governing Council, therefore, decided to identify inflation values consistent with conditions of price stability. Price stability conditions do not necessarily entail stable prices, that is to say zero inflation. Inflation levels which are sufficiently contained to not interfere with economic choices are to be considered indicative of a stable monetary environment, and therefore of price stability. Inflation impinges on a large array of economic activities. For instance, it has an important effect on the way people take decisions about how to allocate resources across time. For example, a household's decision to consume today or instead save and consume in the future; a worker's decision to supply labour; or a firm's decision to invest. Moreover, inflation - especially if it is volatile - creates distortions in the information content of relative prices in the economy. This can lead to incorrect economic decisions if, for instance, firms wrongly interpret a general price increase as a signal of increased demand for their product. It also affects the frequency of changes in businesses' price tags and menus. Importantly, these effects lead to dead-weight losses and distortions in the allocation of resources and, therefore, to socially sub-optimal economic outcomes. The upshot is that the rate of inflation, above which distortions of economic decision-making start becoming material, is not a matter of policy preference, like an inflation target. Instead, it is a structural feature of the economy. It is linked to aspects such as contract and commercial pricing technologies; the tax and welfare system; and the demographic structure of the population, to name but a few. While these structural features of course can and indeed do change, they do so only very gradually and infrequently. Moreover, the direction and size of the effect of any such changes on the non-distortive inflation rate is not a priori clear. It needs to be thoroughly examined and conclusively proven. For surveys of the literature on the costs of inflation, see O. Issing, \\\"Why price stability?\\\", in: A.G. Herrero, V. Gaspar, L. Hoogduin, J. Morgan and B. Winkler (eds.), Why price stability?, First ECB Central Banking Conference, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2001 and G. Camba-Mendez, J.A. Garcia and D. Rodriguez Palenzuela, \\\"Relevant economic issues concerning the optimal rate of inflation\\\", in O. Issing (ed.), Background studies for the ECB's Evaluation of its Monetary Policy Strategy, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2003. Where does this leave us on the proposal to increase the numerical objective pursued by monetary policy? An inflation target can be changed to reflect shifting policy tastes and moving priorities. But a quantitative definition of price stability is a range of inflation values that can be qualified as unproblematic for economic decision-making. And this qualification is a factual statement, not a matter of tactical choice. Changing it on tactical grounds would be opportunistic and would harm the credibility of the central bank. For a central bank like the ECB, wedded to a range of inflation values that can be characterised as indicative of stable prices, a change to this range - and notably to its upper quantitative limit - is not conceivable barring analysis that convincingly argues for a wider range and larger values. A change not justified on these bases would create permanent damage to our ability to steer inflation expectations and contain inflation volatility. A loss of credibility can lead to an overshooting of inflation expectations. This would require a disproportionate withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation in the future to rein in inflation. Any initial boost to economic activity will therefore ultimately be more than reversed. Additional and unnecessary volatility in real activity would be the price to pay. In any case, it seems to me that the trade-off implied by this proposal is rather lopsided. Even if the central bank is successful in engineering precisely the intended permissive conditions as measured by a real interest rate decline, it is far from clear that this would indeed generate real effects even in the short-term. If, for instance, there are quantitative constraints in the availability of credit at play in the economy, the lower short-term real rates will fail to stimulate aggregate demand. Overall, therefore, one risks trading very uncertain gains - in terms of immediate policy accommodation - against rather certain costs - in terms of higher inflation, possibly for an indefinite period. Such risk-payoff structures are perfectly acceptable in the business world. Indeed taking calculated risks is often the mark of a successful business leader. For public policy, however, this strikes me as a deal that should not be made. But for some of the proponents of increasing the central bank's inflation objective this proposal is not motivated by a perceived need to stimulate aggregate demand when nominal interest rates are at zero or close to zero. Instead, they focus on another feature of the crisis: balance sheet adjustment in order to address the over-indebtedness problem. According to this argument, a higher inflation objective makes it less likely that the economy may get trapped in a destructive debt-deflation spiral of the type described by Irving Fisher. In the midst of the Great Depression, Fisher put forward a theory of economic crises that centred on the mutually reinforcing effects between over-indebtedness and deflation. According to this view, over-indebtedness beyond some point triggers distressed asset sales as debt is called in. This leads to abrupt deleveraging and a contraction of the amount of money in circulation. The destruction of money precipitates a fall in the general price level. Deflation in turn causes the real debt and interest burden to go up, thereby triggering a new bout of distressed asset sales and deleveraging and trapping the economy in a vicious circle. Deflation poses risks to the economy that - in some respects - are even more intractable than inflation. It is for this reason that the Governing Council's definition of price stability rules out negative inflation values. Moreover, the Governing Council's policy aim (within the range of positive inflation rates that are consistent with price stability) is sufficiently close to the upper bound of the range to stave off the risk that negative price shocks may unleash a self-reinforcing downward inflation spiral. But engineering financial repression in order to facilitate balance sheet adjustment would clearly violate the mandate to maintain price stability as a primary objective conferred upon the ECB by the Treaty. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the central bank's steering of inflation expectations as an illustration of the notion of control. Moreover, I mentioned that the steadfast pursuit of the central bank's mandate exemplifies the notion of courage. I am very sceptical whether increasing the numerical definition of price stability helps in either of these dimensions. Let me now turn to the second example of an innovative proposal for monetary policy that I would like to discuss today. Unlike the previous proposal, this one does not relate to the objective of the central bank. Instead, it focuses on how the central bank can actually achieve its assigned objective, when the chances that the objective will be hit diminish. As I already mentioned, central banks typically conduct monetary policy by steering nominal short-term interest rates. These are the rates over which they can exert significant influence through the monopoly supply of central bank reserves. It is, however, widely accepted that it is primarily long-term interest rates that matter for the main economic decisions that the central bank wants to influence. How is it then that monetary policy can have an impact on the economy? Well, one can think of long-term interest rates as comprising two elements: expectations regarding the future evolution of short-term rates; and premia. Premia relate to the compensation investors demand for holding on to an asset for a specific period of time (the term premium). Moreover, they relate to the compensation for risks, such as the possibility of incurring capital losses due to difficulties they may encounter when selling the asset back to the market before maturity and at short notice (the liquidity premium). Changes in the current policy rate are typically interpreted by markets to also signal changes for short-term rates in the future. That is, they affect market expectations for future short-term rates and therefore, long-term rates. In normal times, this signalling channel works well and market expectations tend to be in line with monetary policy makers' intended long-term rates. When, however, short-term nominal rates are at zero or close to zero, this signalling channel loses its potency. The risk is that long-term rates may drift away from the central bank's intended path, in which case financing conditions in the economy will not properly reflect the stance of monetary policy. Some academic economists have advocated that, particularly in such a situation, the central bank should engage in active communication regarding the future path of policy rates. If this commitment is sufficiently credible, it will be effective in steering expectations regarding future interest rates and so influence the first component of long-term interest rates to which I was referring before. This is turn, will allow the central bank to deliver accommodative financing conditions in the economy over a certain horizon. A number of central banks around the world - most recently including the US Federal Reserve - have adopted some version of this approach. But the decomposition of long-term rates I mentioned a few moments ago suggests that there is also another possible way for the central bank to deliver appropriate financing conditions in the economy. This second approach is to exert influence on the premia, to the extent that they are unwarranted and reflect dislocations in markets. I would argue that the assessment regarding which approach is more appropriate depends on the particular situation each monetary policy maker faces. The approach focusing on communication regarding the future path of short-term interest rates is in principle applicable to a situation where there is a need to provide general, across the board, stimulus to the economy. Moreover, it applies in currency areas where financing conditions are more or less homogeneous throughout segments of the financial market and of the currency space. By this I mean a situation in which following a reduction in the array of risk-free interest rates, firms or households with comparable characteristics experience a broadly similar decrease in the borrowing rates they are charged for finance. Despite the notable improvements recently, this by and large is not the situation we are facing in the euro area. Domestic financial conditions across euro area countries remain fragmented. The spreads that lenders apply over benchmark rates are very uneven and, in some countries, abnormally high, reflecting dysfunctional market dynamics. Moreover, there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate in the euro area. Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. Under these circumstances, it strikes me as far more appropriate to encourage conditions for a more even distribution of the very permissive liquidity provision that is in place. Engaging in promises regarding the future monetary policy stance would not be the most effective instrument for achieving this. Instead, we need to continue addressing the part of the premia in long-term rates in the euro area that is not warranted. But let me be clear, this does not mean that monetary policy instruments should be used to reduce credit spreads that reflect well-founded concerns regarding long-term debt sustainability and competitiveness. Is this alternative approach effective? In a nutshell I would say that the arsenal of the ECB's instruments for monetary policy implementation continues to be able to induce relaxation of conditions in term borrowing, when this is deemed necessary. In particular, the very long tenor of some of our refinancing operations combined with the full accommodation of banks' demand for such refinancing at the prevailing rate has proven to be very powerful. Indeed, this has been effective in lowering rates along the yield curve, without having to engage in commitments on the future stance of monetary policy to steer expectations. By providing security to our bank counterparties that central bank credit will remain in place for a sufficiently long horizon, we have acted on the liquidity premium component of term interest rates: the spread that remunerates banks lending in the inter-bank market for the risk that their borrowing counterpart may become illiquid and unable to honour the inter-bank credit contract at maturity. This added degree of comfort has encouraged market activity at decreasing term lending rates. But I do not want to imply that the approach that the ECB has followed thus far is free of pitfalls. For instance, the use of refinancing operations with a very long maturity results in an immediate expansion of the balance sheet when implemented. Such an expansion is not without challenges for central bank communication and for managing inflation expectations. Moreover, it has the unintended side-effect that it increases the encumbrance of banks' balance sheets. That is, it increases the share of bank assets that are already pledged as collateral, and thus unavailable to support the borrower's standing in additional credit operations. The share of bank assets that would be available to cover the claims of unsecured creditors in case of a default shrinks. This, in turn, amplifies the perceived loss given default of additional claimants and makes it more difficult for banks to access the unsecured money markets, which in normal times is the main market for marginal bank funding. We are fully aware of this risk and this is part of the reason that we have allowed for early repayment of our 3-year long-term refinancing operations. This way, when a counterparty judges that its chances of accessing market funding are being constrained by its use of ECB 3-year long-term refinancing operations, it can repay all or part of the amount borrowed earlier than its original maturity. In fact, tomorrow is the first opportunity to make use of the early repayment option. Euro area banks have taken this opportunity and have informed us that they will repay $\\u20ac 137$ billion of the slightly more than $\\u20ac 1$ trillion outstanding in such long-term operations. We will exert vigilance to ensure that - notwithstanding the legitimate decisions of individual banks to reduce their liabilities to the central bank - the overall liquidity conditions prevailing in the money market will remain consistent with the degree of accommodation that the current outlook for prices and real activity warrant. Whichever of the two approaches a central bank decides to use, it needs to be well appreciated that there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve. Delivering accommodative financing conditions and ample liquidity to the banking system has been necessary to avoid an abrupt deleveraging that could tip the economy into a destructive deflationary spiral. But parts of the banking system remain overstretched and this needs to be addressed in order to move decisively out of the crisis. Similarly, structural reforms need to be undertaken in order to restore the competitiveness of euro area economies. Only such reforms can deliver a lasting reversal of the fragmentation phenomena that the euro area has witnessed. And clearly neither of these tasks can be taken up by monetary policy. Let me conclude with a cautionary tale. Innovation is the quintessence of entrepreneurship and a cornerstone for economic growth and prosperity in market-based economies. But there can be innovations that create more problems than the ones they were originally conceived to address. I am reminded of the two mortal sins of economic policy-making that clearly transpire when reading Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's excellent book on financial crises: arrogance and ignorance. Transposing this insight to the discussion on monetary policy frameworks, I would say that it is dangerously arrogant to believe that one's current approach to monetary policy is perfect and no improvements or changes will ever be needed. Certainly, before the crisis, a certain degree of academic group thinking and central bank professional hubris bred a sense of accomplishment that proved exceedingly complacent and ultimately self-defeating. Looking forward, we should temper a tendency to self-complacency - if not arrogance - with the strength of thought and the courage of vision. But courage and vision should not entice us into hazardous experimentations. We should not be ignorant of the lessons that history has taught. And history has shown that inflation was permanently brought under control when the public's inflation expectations became safely anchored. This in turn occurred when central banks gained credibility regarding their determination to stabilise inflation. This credibility was hard-earned but can be eroded easily. It would be irresponsible to jeopardise it. As regards the ECB in particular, I am convinced that our existing monetary policy framework provides enough scope for instruments to continue addressing the crisis in a decisive and effective way. We remain attentive to possible shortcomings in our policy framework and to changes in the structure of the economy that would warrant revisiting aspects of this framework. At present, however, I see no compelling case for change. Thank you very much for your attention.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cut\",\n          \"rise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Kugler presents a lecture about inflation dynamics and the Phillips Curve to students in Harvard University's Ec10b Principles of Economics class on Monday, April 7, 2025. In the lecture she discusses how pandemic-era inflation came in a series of waves: food, core goods, core services and housing. She then talks about the Phillips curve as a model to capture inflation dynamics. Finally, Governor Kugler explores additional augmentations to the Phillips curve model that could help better explain the most recent inflation episode.\",\n          \"February 20, 2025 Risks and Challenges for Bank Regulation and Supervision Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr At Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. Banks play an indispensable role in an economy that works for everyone.1 They enable households to borrow to buy a home, save for the future, and deal with the ups and downs of managing finances. Banks provide the credit for businesses to smooth out income and expenses, supply capital to seize new opportunities and create jobs, and facilitate the flow of payments that are the lifeblood of our economy. And banks borrow from households and businesses as well, such as through federally insured deposits. Because of these vital roles, we need to make sure that banks are resilient and serve as a source of strength to the economy in both good times and when the financial system comes under stress. In our market economy, like any business, banks compete with each other and pursue profits by balancing risk-taking with safety and soundness. But because of the key role banks play in the economy, and the fact that banks do not fully internalize the costs of their own failure, regulation and supervision must ensure that banks do not take on excessive risks that can cause widespread harm to households and businesses. Bank failures are as old as banking, and we've seen repeated waves of bank failures over the centuries. America learned that hard lesson nearly 100 years ago, when bank failures played a central role in the Great Depression. In response, the United States and many other countries around the globe set up a system of deposit insurance and enabled emergency lending in times of stress. To balance the moral hazard of the federal safety net, Congress established a framework of regulation and supervision to make it more likely that banks internalize the costs to society of their risk-taking. But finance is always evolving, and the buildup of new risks led to the banking crisis of the 1980s, and then to the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating consequences. Weaknesses that were revealed in regulation and supervision led to unprecedented and unpopular bailouts, and shuttered American businesses, devastated local communities with foreclosures, and millions of individuals lost their jobs and their livelihoods. Government responded in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and in regulatory reforms by significantly strengthening bank oversight to curb excessive risk-taking. The message from the American people was clear: risk-taking must be balanced with the overarching need to maintain a resilient banking system that can continue to play its crucial role for households and businesses in good times and in bad. Another, perennial lesson from the history of bank regulation and supervision is that the job is never done, and that the constant evolution of finance means risks will also evolve. As Vice Chair for Supervision, I have recognized the need to approach this mission with humility, aware that I don't have all the answers or perfect foresight of where things can go wrong. Both regulators and banks are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify and measure risks. Our financial system is complex, interconnected, and evolving. We cannot fully appreciate how a specific vulnerability can interact with other vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the face of shocks, let alone accurately anticipate shocks in time to avoid them. When I became Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022, the Global Financial Crisis was almost 15 years past, and much had been done to strengthen the resilience of the system to reflect lessons learned. But in March 2023, we experienced the second largest bank failure in history, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. SVB's failure triggered stress throughout the system and required the issuance of a systemic risk exemption and the creation of an emergency bank lending program.2 We have made some progress toward addressing the gaps that led to the failures. But there will be headwinds that we must guard against in the coming years, as well as ongoing vulnerabilities and areas of risk that require continued vigilance. Earlier this year, I announced I would step down as Vice Chair for Supervision but remain a member of the Board of Governors. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of households and businesses. I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor. In this role, I'll continue to participate in monetary policy deliberations and vote on matters before the Board, including those related to supervision and regulation. While it was a tough decision to make, I believe it was the right decision for the institution and, more importantly, for the public, whom we serve. The risk of a dispute over my position would be a distraction from our important mission. I feel strongly as Chair Powell has said publicly many times that the independence of the Federal Reserve is critical to our ability to meet our statutory mandates and serve the American public. Put simply, our mission is too important to let such a dispute distract from doing our job for the American people. Since my term for Vice Chair for Supervision will end later this month, I'd like to use one of my last opportunities as Vice Chair to discuss seven specific risks ahead: (1) maintaining and finishing post-financial crisis reforms; (2) maintaining the credibility of the stress test; (3) maintaining credible, consistent supervision; (4) encouraging responsible innovation; (5) addressing cyber and third-party risk; (6) risks in the nonbank sector; and (7) climate risk. Each will continue to be a risk in either the near- or long-term. Maintaining and Finishing Post-Financial Crisis Reforms There is always push back on financial regulation. I felt that even in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, as I helped to draft the legislative response to that crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act.3 And I felt that over the last few years as we worked to finish the job of post-crisis financial reform and take up evolving threats revealed from the latest bank stress. It is important to get the balance right, but it is also important to stand up for the American people. I urge regulators to finish the job of implementing the final plank of the Global Financial Crisis reforms and not to dismantle the hard-fought resilience that banks have built up in the process. Of course, there are always ways to increase efficiency and reform prior methods without costs to resiliency, and I support those efforts. But as I've spoken about many times, capital is critical to absorb losses and enable banks to continue operations through times of stress, and capital requirements should be aligned with the risks that banks take.4 The Basel III endgame reforms include many improvements to how we measure credit, trading, operational, and derivatives risks in light of our experience in the Global Financial Crisis. All major jurisdictions except the United States have finalized rules that would implement these standards for their internationally active banks. The Federal Reserve played a central role in developing these standards in the many years before my arrival as Vice Chair. The Board sought comment on a proposal in July 2023 to implement the Basel III reforms, and we received a wide range of comments on the proposal.5 On the basis of those comments, I took steps last fall to outline broad and material changes that would better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received and would result in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of banks.6 These reforms had broad consensus on the Board and the support of the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. When the U.S. provides leadership in international forums like Basel and then follows through, we set a powerful example and establish a standard that other jurisdictions also uphold. Implementing international standards enables U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field across the globe and makes the system safer. When we don't follow through on our commitments, for whatever reason, concerns about a level playing field rise in other jurisdictions, in an international \\\"race to the bottom\\\" on standards. This harms us all and makes U.S. banks less competitive. And unless the U.S. implements these standards, other jurisdictions will force U.S. banks operating abroad to meet their standards instead. Let me turn to unfinished business from the March 2023 banking stress. In that event, we learned that bank runs and bank failures can happen fast, much faster than before. Before SVB, the largest bank to fail did so over a period of several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours.7 Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked with banks to improve their ability to borrow from the discount window, and the financial system's collective readiness has improved significantly compared to pre-SVB, including with a substantial increase of $1 trillion in collateral pledged across the system.8 The Federal Reserve has also worked to improve the functioning of the discount window, through a concerted effort to gather public input and identify areas for modernization. These efforts have improved the ability of banks to weather stress, both individually and collectively, which enhances financial stability. However, there is still more work to do. For instance, banks, even the largest banks, are not currently required to establish a minimum level of readiness at the window, and, as a result, there are outlier firms that are not prepared for stress. This needs to change. Without a requirement there is also a significant risk of backtracking on the substantial progress in readiness we have made since March 2023. Another important lesson from SVB is a classic one: balance sheet vulnerabilities among a group of institutions can be a source of contagion for the financial system and thus a key stability risk. While we did much to improve the resilience of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the past decade, March 2023 showed that significant systemic risks can develop and spread from stress anywhere in the system, including in large and regional banks that are not G-SIBs.9 The resilience of these firms has improved as they have recognized their vulnerabilities, and we have worked through supervisory channels to encourage risk-management practices that put them on a firmer footing. But we also need to put in place more durable solutions to address risks. For one, the level of capital held by large banks needs to align with the underlying risks on their balance sheets. One important step would be to finalize the requirement that all large firms reflect unrealized losses on available for sale securities in their capital, which is a reform with broad agreement. This will help them manage interest rate risk before it gets to extreme levels, a significant problem revealed in the banking stress of two years ago. Another lesson from the spring of 2023 is that large and regional banks as well as G-SIBs should ensure that they can actually monetize the securities on which they rely for their liquidity. Why does this matter? Banks need to be able to turn a portion of their assets into cash with a speed sufficient to meet outflows when uninsured depositors or other short-term creditors demand it. Regulation needs to reflect realistic assumptions about monetization. We should also consider updating some assumptions about deposit outflows in our liquidity requirements so that they better align with observed stress behavior. During the stress in 2023, we saw uninsured deposits from high-net worth individuals and certain entities, such as venture capital firms, behave more like highly sophisticated financial counterparties than nonfinancial companies or ordinary retail depositors, which is how they are generally treated in regulations.10 This mis-measured risk of deposit outflows means banks may not have sufficient liquidity to manage a stress period. In a related vein, banks have stepped up their use of reciprocal deposit arrangements arrangements where deposits are spread across many banks within a network as a way to manage the risk of deposit amounts over $250,000.11 While this arrangement spreads risk across the banking system, it is a strategy that has not been tested in a large-scale stress event. It is only logical to wonder how the attenuation of relationships between customers and banks under reciprocal arrangements will affect the behavior of depositors worried about a bank run. We also need to be attentive to operational risks in these arrangements, as well as the risk-management capacity of these companies to manage these relationships under stress. A final lesson from the bank stress two years ago is that we need to do more to ensure that all banks that come under stress can be resolved in an orderly fashion. One way to do this would be to require all large banks including those that are not G-SIBS to issue certain amounts of long-term debt. This would have helped reassure depositors worried about the stability of bank funding and aided in the eventual resolution of at least some of the banks that came under stress in 2023. The banking agencies have proposed a rule on long-term debt requirements, we have received many helpful comments that led us to adjust it in draft form, and I support moving forward to finalize it with those adjustments.12 As I mentioned, revised Basel III standards, revised long-term debt requirements, and to-be-proposed liquidity standards would help to address gaps in our current framework, and I continue to believe that they should move forward. Moreover, banks and supervisors should also stay vigilant to known risks in the current environment. For instance, risks remain in the commercial real estate market, particularly within the office segment, as borrowers may find it difficult to refinance maturing loans. And interest rate risk, especially for those with high levels of uninsured deposits, remains a key area of focus. Maintain the Credibility of the Stress Test We face a challenging environment with the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. The stress tests helped the financial sector emerge from the Global Financial Crisis and rebuild its credibility. The annual stress tests are still important to the financial sector's credibility today. The stress tests help banks, market participants, and supervisors understand the banks' vulnerabilities to shocks and to guard against those shocks by holding sufficient capital. In December, the Board announced that, due to the evolving legal landscape, we would be undertaking significant changes to the stress tests to reduce capital volatility and improve transparency.13 While I recognize that we need to increase transparency to reflect changes in the legal environment in which we operate, there are good reasons why I and many of my colleagues and predecessors have been averse to such full disclosures since the inception of the stress test fifteen years ago. There are several risks that we will need to guard against. First, we need to guard against the risk that the process results in reduced capital requirements. As they did during the Basel III process, banks are likely to argue against various aspects of the Fed's models that result in higher capital requirements, and not to highlight the areas in which the models underestimate risks. We should take those comments on the Fed's models seriously and adjust the models as appropriate, but we should be careful not to overcorrect and lower bank capital requirements in ways that underestimate aggregate risk. The Administrative Procedure Act should be a vehicle for transparency and public input into agency action, not used to weaken regulatory requirements that preserve the safety and stability of our financial system. Second, we need to guard against the risk that banks lower their capital requirements because of increased transparency. Increased disclosure of details about the Fed's stress models could enable banks to optimize stress test results by adjusting their balance sheet based on their knowledge of where the models underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements without materially reducing risks. Gaming the test in this way would be a bad outcome for risk management and our economy. Third, banks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. We should be aware of the risk that full transparency into the models and scenarios used by regulators could discourage banks from investing in their own risk management if the test becomes too predictable. Full transparency may also encourage concentration across the system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. And banks are likely to reduce their management buffers over required levels, which will bring greater risks of breaching the minimums and regulatory buffers when a significant risk event eventually happens. The fourth risk, and perhaps the greatest one, is that over time, given the difficulty of navigating the notice and comment rulemaking process on an ongoing basis to update the models we use, the dynamism and accuracy of the stress test will fade.14 And as the events of two years ago show, it is hard to predict where risks will emerge in the financial system; an inherent challenge of preserving the relevancy of stress testing is coming up with a set of adverse scenarios that are novel enough, and dynamic enough, to reflect the risks that banks may face from unanticipated developments. I believe that the Fed should commit to investing in a credible, effective process to maintain the dynamism of the binding stress test by regularly updating its models and scenario variables to reflect changes in the environment and changes to bank behavior. This will require resources and a strong commitment up front and over time, but it will be necessary to maintain a credible stress test. One effort we've already undertaken should help: to maintain the dynamism of the stress test, we launched exploratory stress scenarios to consider a wider range of possible conditions.15 The Fed used this approach during the pandemic, and we've now made it a regular part of our annual stress test exercise.16 The exploratory scenarios are not used to set binding capital requirements and are only reported on an aggregate level, but they help the Fed better understand risks posed to individual banks and to the banking system as a whole that are not captured in binding scenarios. I hope and trust that the Fed will continue this important analytical work. As an additional backstop to help ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand losses, the Fed should preserve its discretion to set individually binding capital requirements on firms based on supervisory judgment under the International Lending Supervision Act. Jurisdictions around the world undertake a similar process under a so-called Basel \\\"Pillar 2\\\" approach, and the United States would benefit from using such a framework as well. That is all the more important given the changes the Fed is undertaking for the binding stress tests. Maintaining Credible, Consistent Supervision Another area warranting continued vigilance is supervision. There will undoubtedly be calls to revamp supervision to reduce burden. And I am all for making sure supervision is the most effective and efficient it can be. Supervisors need to focus on the most urgent and important risks, and not burden firms with unnecessary or distracting matters. But we need to be careful to preserve and enhance the ability of supervisors to act with speed, force, and agility as appropriate to the risk. Supervisors have emphasized proactive supervisory engagement, which helps banks address issues before they grow so large as to threaten the bank or broader financial stability. Earlier intervention means that firms are likely to have more options to fix their problems, with little impact on bank profitability.17 We should continue work to improve the effectiveness of our supervision and use data-driven analysis to improve our scoping and prioritization of supervisory issues. I support this work to the extent that it makes our supervision more effective and focused on the right issues. But the Board should resist initiatives that impede effective supervision by discouraging examiners to flag issues early, or initiatives that increase unnecessary process around issuing findings in a manner that impedes the speed and agility of supervision when it is needed. More generally, supervision is another area in which \\\"efficiency and competitiveness\\\" should not be used as an excuse for lax oversight that significantly impairs the safety and soundness of individual institutions and undermines broader financial stability. We should take caution from our experience with SVB. While some have claimed that the examiners at SVB did not focus on the right issues, it's important to highlight that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the Fed allocated an insufficient number of examiner resources to SVB while in the RBO portfolio, and that the examiners assigned to SVB as it was growing did not have sufficient expertise in supervising large, complex institutions.18 Once it was in the large bank portfolio, examiners highlighted the risk from interest rate risk and uninsured depositors, but did not act with sufficient force to get the bank to change course in a timely way. We've made important changes since then, but we need to be sure we get the staff resources in place, and provide support to examiners on the front line, so that they can act with the speed, force, and agility warranted by the facts. Encouraging Responsible Innovation Another set of risks involve those related to the role of innovative technology in the financial sector. Innovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial institutions, and the economy at large. For instance, blockchain technology underlying crypto-assets has the potential to make financial services better, cheaper, and faster. Responsible use of this technology could make banking more efficient and accessible to more consumers. With any new technology, there are new risks. To achieve the benefits in a durable manner over time, we must ensure that the associated risks are managed appropriately. With crypto-assets, investors do not currently have the structural protections they have relied on for many decades in other financial markets. It is important that those guardrails are put in place to avoid issues such as the misuse of client funds, misrepresentations, obfuscation about availability of deposit insurance, and fraud. We should also recognize that some of the attractive attributes of crypto-assets the pseudonymous actors that are parties to transactions, the ease and speed of transfer, and the general irrevocability of transactions also make crypto-assets attractive for use in money laundering and terrorist financing. It is encouraging to see innovators develop tools and processes to better manage these risks, while harnessing the benefits of the technology. But regulation and supervision also have an essential role to play. Responsible innovation is in everyone's interest. In the past few years, we stood up the Novel Activities Supervision Program, which dedicates resources to understanding how technology is transforming banking and supports banks' ability to innovate while ensuring that banks clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities.19 I hope and trust that approach will continue. Addressing Cyber and Third-Party Risk Cyber risk from both foreign powers and non-state actors has become a major concern for banks, and regulators will need to ensure that these risks are being properly managed. The operational disruption propagated through a third-party security company last summer was a wake-up call for banks and regulators about vulnerabilities in a system where security is outsourced. Disruption of one of these critical systems may compromise a bank's ability to execute important functions and adversely affect individual firm safety and soundness as well as the broader financial system. Given the significant concentration in the IT industry, we should expect operational failures at single IT entities to have potentially far-reaching effects, no matter their original cause. And advances in artificial intelligence are likely to give bad actors new tools for fraud and infiltration, while also providing banks with new tools to combat these attacks. Both banks and the Federal Reserve need to continue to invest in cyber resiliency. Risks in the Nonbank Sector Let me speak next to the perennial concerns of intermediation by financial firms outside the bank regulatory perimeter. An increasingly varied and evolving collection of nonbank clients, including hedge funds, private credit, and insurance companies, is playing a significant role in the global economy and presenting new risks. Beginning with hedge funds, bank exposures to hedge funds have risen over the past several years, and concurrently, hedge fund leverage remains near historic highs.20 Archegos's failure revealed the risks presented by hedge funds and the degree of interconnectedness between banks and hedge funds. And the exploratory analysis as part of last year's stress test showed that banks have material exposures to hedge funds under certain market conditions, and that the hedge fund counterparty exposures can vary significant based on the specific set of shocks.21 One area that has grown substantially is the Treasury cash-futures basis trade.22 The basis trade helps provide liquidity and price discovery in normal times, as hedge funds trade with asset managers and other financial institutions to align returns to holding Treasury securities and related futures. But the trade involves high levels of leverage, which can contribute to a rapid unwinding in positions and exacerbate market stress, as we saw in the spring of 2020. In principle, margining practices and participants' risk-management activities should limit these risks, but individual firms do not account for the spillovers their actions can have on market functioning. These externalities suggest a role for regulation, and the central clearing mandate for Treasury market trading is an important step in supporting the resilience of this market. At the same time, we need to continue to consider how we can support the collection of minimum margin across trading venues and in bilateral trades to avoid loopholes and risks, and continue to monitor banks' credit risk management practices with these hedge fund counterparties. Another area that has experienced rapid growth in recent years is private credit, which is now comparable in size to the high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market.23 Traditional private credit arrangements rely on limited leverage and generally have long-term funding, making them less vulnerable to the deleveraging spiral associated with high leverage and short-term funding. Nonetheless, risks may be growing. The connections between private credit and banks have been expanding, and private credit remains opaque, with limited information relative to asset classes of similar size.24 Moreover, the rapid growth and opacity of the sector raise the risk that recent private credit arrangements may be assuming new risks. Retail investors can now gain exposure to the asset class through mutual or exchange traded funds, which could present the age-old consumer and financial stability risks we see when opaque, illiquid assets are converted to liquid ones.25 We also need to monitor risks in the insurance industry. Households planning for retirement often rely on life insurance companies to provide them a steady stream of income. In principle, life insurance companies are the ultimate patient investor and thus the natural vehicle to finance long-maturity and risky projects. Indeed, while venture capital funding gets a lot of the attention, mobilized retirement savings through life insurance companies have supported long-term investments in capital-intensive projects. However, life insurance companies, just like other financial institutions, can overpromise and be tempted to take on greater risk than their liability holders or regulators appreciate. Given the complexity of some investment vehicles, the institutions themselves may not fully appreciate all of the risks. The life insurance sector has been changing. Even as the life insurance industry has been increasing its holdings of assets originated by private equity firms, private equity firms have been acquiring life insurers directly. Moreover, private-equity-affiliated insurers rely more heavily on nontraditional liabilities, which may prove flighty in a stress event. This is something to watch carefully. In the next business cycle downturn, it's possible that unexpected losses at insurance companies could lead to a sharp pullback and deeper credit crunch. Climate Risk Finally, regulators will need to continue to confront the financial risks from climate change. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to recognize emerging risks to the safety and soundness of banks, to the ability of households and businesses to access financial services, and to financial stability. Costly natural disasters could present just such risks. The recent wildfires in California should be a wake-up call that we need to focus on how insurance markets will need to adjust to more frequent and severe weather events. The loss of life and hardship borne by many households is tragic, and the economic losses associated with the wildfires, while uncertain, are likely to be among the largest losses from a natural disaster on record. The wildfires should remind us of the problems in property and casualty insurance markets just as the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Helene reminded us of significant gaps in flood insurance coverage. Often the structure and regulation of insurance markets prevents risk from being appropriately priced, limiting the ability of market signals to influence development and adaptation in high-risk areas and contributing to the buildup of risks. And there is a broader question of the extent to which private capital will be sufficient to cover increasing natural disaster risk. The Federal Reserve has an important but narrow role to play with respect to climate change, and that is to focus on risks from climate change to bank safety and soundness and financial stability. The pilot climate scenario analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve was an important step forward in assessing the capacity of the largest banks, as well as in building our own capacity, to perform the kind of analysis that is increasingly crucial as risks arising from more severe weather events become a driver of financial risk for specific firms and the broader economy.26 Guidance for the largest banks also plays an important role in reminding banks of basic principles in prudent risk management as it applies to these types of climate-related risks. Conclusion In conclusion, the United States has the benefit of a strong, vigorous economy, the deepest and most liquid markets in the world, and a critical place in the world economy through the role of the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve has an essential role in maintaining the strength and resilience of the U.S. economy, including through its vigilance about the risks I discussed today. A strong and resilient banking system benefits the American people. We need to be humble about our ability to predict shocks to the financial system, and how they will propagate through vulnerabilities in the system. That is why it is so important to have strong regulation and supervision as shock absorbers to protect households and businesses from risks emanating from the financial system. In closing, I want to speak directly to the staff of the Federal Reserve and express my deep gratitude. Your rigorous analysis and deep expertise are fundamental to our ability to promote a strong and stable financial system that serves the American people. Thank you for your outstanding service.\",\n          \"March 21, 2025 Statement by Governor Christopher J. Waller Governor Christopher J. Waller At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I supported no change in the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings. Reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is an important part of normalizing monetary policy implementation and reducing unneeded reserves in the banking system. Slowing further or stopping redemptions of securities holdings will be appropriate as we get closer to an ample level of reserves. But in my view we are not there yet because reserve balances stand at over $3 trillion and this level is abundant. There is no evidence from money market indicators or my outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves. The Committee slowed the pace of redemptions in June 2024 to help ensure a smooth transition to the appropriate level of securities holdings needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. I believe that pace continues to be the right one. If unanticipated disturbances to reserve demand emerge on the path to balance sheet normalization, the Federal Reserve System has a variety of tools to address such a development. Rather than changing our current pace of balance sheet reduction, the Federal Reserve should rely on those tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge. Such a plan could be implemented swiftly in the event more reserves need to be injected into the banking system. Even with the decision to slow the pace of runoff at this meeting, a plan is still required should a disturbance occur in the future. While this is a procedural matter, good process leads to good outcomes, and good contingency planning helps avoid disruptions to markets and to the FOMC's efforts to achieve our economic objectives.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Waller At Lectures of the Governor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, France Thank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of lectures from central bankers.1 I will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. But on this occasion, I thought it appropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges that OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we approach monetary policy and our other responsibilities. I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine quarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this robust economic growth, the labor market softened over 2024, and employment is now near what I judge to be the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) maximum-employment objective. I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months. With regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023, progress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024. Our latest reading of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months ending in November. This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2 percent. This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy rate. However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate. Let me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal. First, as we saw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but disinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks. To tease out the underlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE prices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving down toward 2 percent over the course of the year. Second, the monthly reading for November came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in October. Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices, such as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly observed and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across all goods and services in the economy. These two categories represent about one-third of the core PCE basket. If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core PCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through November. I don't support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-market services, but I find it notable that imputed prices, rather than observed prices, were driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path. Finally, the higher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in January. This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers through March. Looking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times in recent years. In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of upward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year. Projections of the economic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely. If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy. Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted before we can seriously consider their effects. So what is my view? If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025. The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening. Based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median of policymakers' expected appropriate policy rate this year implies two 25 basis point cuts.2 But the range of views is quite large, from no cuts to as many as five cuts for different FOMC participants. As always, the extent of further easing will depend on what the data tell us about progress toward 2 percent inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate. Let me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame monetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond. Each of the issues I raise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in some places than others. I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so please don't take any signal from the order in which they are raised. I will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our targets for inflation. While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in most jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators of the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running persistently above target. Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD economies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls. I believe policy is still restrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have inflation at their targets going forward. This common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the common experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions before and during the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and forcefulness of policy responses. The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the result of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge varied across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown by research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.3 A common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of goods production and delivery.4 Shortages of key components and waves of COVID variants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist. Fortunately, these disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. That said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies volatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation. Another common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic. The extent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses during the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.5 Regardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to a doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger percentages in some places. Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still higher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many OECD members. Another recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in manufacturing. Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic, when consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods. But as businesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the swing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in manufacturing in OECD economies. This slide has been compounded by three other factors. First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the past couple of years raised capital costs in this sector. As monetary policy eases across countries, this effect may unwind. Also, higher energy costs after Russia's attack on Ukraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors. And lastly, China's push to reduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos has had a big impact across OECD economies. While the manufacturing sector is a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD countries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the prospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere. The extent and timing of tariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects. Overall, the evolution of manufacturing adds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers' outlooks. A short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among OECD countries is geopolitical risk. Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are elevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Today however, you certainly can't see much evidence for geopolitical risk affecting financial markets. But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge that central bankers will need to keep in mind. The outbreak of war in Europe and, more recently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as we have seen recently in Syria. It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect security, trade, and migration flows around the world. The fact that these conflicts have not affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn't mean they can't and won't. Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and economic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and employment.6 I expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to consider geopolitical risk in the medium term. The next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both shorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a \\\"rethink of globalization.\\\" For close to a decade now, many countries have been reexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor, and goods that was the norm over previous decades. Although global trade has not decreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more countries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening supply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs. This isn't simply the result of some failed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict. Rather, it has been a persistent and widespread trend that has been under way for some time. The presumption that the increasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would inevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was. At the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have, the \\\"end of globalization,\\\" because I don't believe that this will be the outcome. As I think about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this organization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I would say that globalization is not going away. What I do expect, however, is there will be more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the people we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer integration and the potential benefits. As these decisions by governments are made, central bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary policy and promoting financial stability. Another longer-term challenge involves demographic trends. What I mean here is the aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else. While this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for central bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices. In the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the population in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033. Aging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries. This is a slow-moving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement, employment and economic output fall. This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can affect consumption, investment and inflation. As aging populations sell accumulated assets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the latter potentially affecting the central bank's estimate of the neutral policy rate. There are mitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age, immigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers. Again, these demographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to monetary policy. Productivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been the subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year. According to one set of estimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative GDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares in other countries. Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is hard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.7 Having some understanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers thinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation. Central bankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly without igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased. Productivity growth also plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r. Higher productivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r for some policymakers and thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation or restrictiveness for policy.8 One way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to compare the United States to other OECD countries. While it is not particularly new for productivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some differences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the pandemic.9 First, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during COVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may have led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more productive. Second, during the acute U.S. labor shortages in 2022 and 2023, I heard numerous anecdotes that firms had to invest more in worker training to raise skill levels to what was necessary for positions. This raises labor productivity with a delay, and it may have been an important factor recently. Third, business creation is, by all evidence, easier in the United States, and new firms often are more productive than existing firms. There was a surge in U.S. business creation after COVID, which could reasonably have led to a more productive re-allocation of labor. There may have been other factors. I don't think that artificial intelligence (AI) was one of them. AI investment will take place over many years and most likely has not done much yet to add to productive capacity. While it is possible AI could increase longer-run productivity growth, that remains to be seen. But the other possible reasons the flexibility of labor rules, ease of business entry, barriers to innovation, lower regulatory hurdles would sound familiar to people attending OECD discussions a decade ago. The barriers to innovative risk-taking are probably lower and the rewards higher in the United States. So while I am skeptical that AI is already making significant contributions to productivity growth, I have little doubt that it will do so. AI and allied innovations in computing have the potential to bring productivity advances to high-skill labor-intensive services, akin to the way robotics transformed high-skill manufacturing. If such advances do occur, one challenge for governments will be fostering an economy in which those dislocated by such a shift can obtain new skills and find productive and meaningful employment. As ever, prudent regulation should be balanced with support for innovation that has the potential to deliver widespread improvements in living standards. But regulatory policy should not strangle innovation in its infancy. So, at the end of this list of challenges, how should central banks meet them? There will always be new challenges, but the right approach to monetary policy hasn't changed, nor should it. In every case, the answer begins with sticking to our mandates and resisting the temptation to go beyond them. We must closely monitor economic and financial conditions and look in every direction, and down the road, for emerging risks. In keeping to our mandates, we concede that seeing all these risks clearly is hard, so we need to remain focused. We also need to be nimble in responding to unfamiliar risks and be prepared to use our monetary policy tools in new ways to prepare for unprecedented challenges that may present themselves. When conditions are uncertain, as they often are, we must move deliberately but also be ready to act quickly and decisively when the situation demands it, as we did in subduing inflation. Effective monetary policy depends on clearly communicating our intentions so that the public will act on those intentions. That also requires credibility, and this is most effectively maintained when monetary policy decisions are made according to our mandates and in the longer-term interest of a healthy economy and stable financial system. Guided by these basic principles, I believe that central bankers are up to the considerable challenges of today, and those we will face in the years ahead.\",\n          \"February 04, 2025 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson At the Economics Department Special Lecture, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania Thank you, Professor Smith. It is an honor to be speaking to you today here at Lafayette College.1 I am glad to have the opportunity to return to such a historically important place as Easton, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley. This area was part of this country's colonial beginnings, it was instrumental in the rising of the industrial age, and, as the home to Crayola, it very literally played a role in coloring how we see the world. Today, this region is leading the way forward with its many outstanding institutions of higher education, very prominently including, of course, Lafayette College. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views of appropriate monetary policy. This is a useful time to do that, as my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policymaking body, held our first meeting of 2025 just last week. Overall, the U.S. economy is starting the year in a good position. I expect inflation's slow descent to continue, and I anticipate that economic growth and labor market conditions will remain solid. I have learned, however, that it is wise to be humble about my projections. There is always a great deal of uncertainty around any economic forecast, and currently we face additional uncertainties about the exact shape of government policies, as well as their economic implications. Last week, my FOMC colleagues and I discussed the latest economic developments and reviewed data that arrived since our previous policy meeting in December. At the conclusion of that meeting, I voted in support of the Committee's decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-14 to 4-12 percent. This decision was made in support of our goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. I remain focused on setting policy to achieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices. Sound monetary policy and positive supply-side developments have contributed to the achievement of sustained economic growth in recent years, the return of low unemployment, and inflation moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective. I remain committed to returning inflation to our target while sustaining the solid labor market. Now is an appropriate time to assess the path forward for the economy. I am happy to be here today to share my views with you. Economic Activity The U.S. economy appears to be maintaining its momentum after growing at a solid pace last year. Last year's growth was notable because many private forecasters in 2023 projected a significant downturn sometime in 2024.2 However, data over the past year painted a very different picture. GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to last week's data release.3 As you can see in figure 1, that extends a stretch of solid quarterly growth over the past couple of years. Shortly, when I discuss the labor market, I will say more related to the large swing in GDP growth in 2020 that stands out in this chart. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.5 percent, which is a modest slowing from the 3.2 percent growth in 2023. The economy has been benefiting from positive supply developments, including more workers joining the labor force and higher labor productivity. The resilience of American consumers is the driving force behind the solid economic growth seen in recent quarters. Household spending, adjusted for inflation, grew 3.2 percent in 2024, slightly stronger than in 2023. The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside. As you can see in figure 2, personal consumption increased at a faster pace each quarter last year. Nominal retail sales rose briskly in the second half of last year. Private-sector data are consistent with GDP figures. According to private surveys of businesses, activity in the services sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, has been on a general upward trajectory since mid-2020.4 Elsewhere in the economy, growth has been less robust. Residential investment has been fairly flat over the past three quarters, and growth of business fixed investment cooled last year from its strong 2023 pace. Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports. Indeed, domestic manufacturing industrial production was flat last year. Overall, I see the economy as continuing to grow at a healthy pace this year, though I anticipate growth to be slightly lower than what we observed in 2024. Households and firms face an uncertain environment, and that tends to lower consumer spending and business investment. If consumer spending continues to grow at the same pace as it has in the past two years, however, that could cause me to revise up my outlook for overall economic growth. Labor Market Turning to employment, I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with conditions broadly returning to balance after a period of being overheated. It's helpful to step back and look at the labor market's path over the past five years. Looking at figure 3, you can see that the unemployment rate surged in early 2020, peaking at 14.8 percent in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold and a wide swath of the global economy was shutdown. The unemployment rate subsequently fell swiftly as the economy recovered. By April 2023, it touched 3.4 percent, a half-century low. At that point, many employers reported that they were struggling to fill openings. Then, over the latter part of 2023 and early 2024, the unemployment rate rose nearly a percentage point, an unusual pattern outside of a recession. As a policymaker, I took note of this rise when considering our dual-mandate objectives. Now, I have also taken note that the unemployment rate has effectively held steady since the middle of last year. I view that as a sign that downside risks in the labor market have abated. The latest jobs report showed that the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in December, the same reading as in June 2024.5 That is low by historical standards and close to estimates of the longer-run rate that is consistent with our employment mandate. In the three months ending in December, payrolls rose by an average of 170,000 jobs a month. While employment growth has eased somewhat from the early part of last year, the steady unemployment rate suggests that payroll gains have been sufficient to absorb new entrants to the labor market. The general moderation in hiring is consistent with other measures showing that the demand for labor has come into better balance with the supply of workers. Looking at figure 4, you can see that as of November, there were 1.2 job openings for every unemployed person seeking work. That ratio is down from 2.0 in 2022, when the labor market was overheated. Also notice that the current vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is just a little below its value before the pandemic took hold. And while hiring has eased from the pace in 2023, layoffs have not increased. As you can see in figure 5, the number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits has trended at historically low levels for the past three years. Consistent with a moderation in hiring and a steady unemployment rate, workers' wage gains have slowed from when the labor market was overheated. Still, the pace of increase in average hourly earnings has been healthy, increasing 3.9 percent during the 12 months ending in December, and shows that, on average, worker pay has grown at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. Looking broadly across the past several months, I see a labor market that is in solid condition and not a source of significant inflationary pressure. While the downside risks of a rapidly weakening labor market appear to have lessened, I expect some further softening that could cause the unemployment rate to edge just slightly higher this year but stay in a range consistent with recent readings. Inflation Thinking about the other component of our dual mandate, inflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent objective. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.2 percent in June 2022. Looking at the blue line in figure 6, you can see that it has since come down to 2.6 percent as of this past December. Economists also pay close attention to core inflation, which excludes often volatile food and energy costs. That core PCE inflation figure, shown by the red dashed line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. By December 2024, it had eased to 2.8 percent. Annualized inflation over the past three months has been closer to our 2 percent objective. As you can see, the path of disinflation has been bumpy. I expect that to continue to be the case. I find it helpful to look at the components of inflation to better understand underlying trends. Looking at figure 7, core goods inflation, the blue line, is running close to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a better alignment between supply and demand after pandemic-related distortions. Nonhousing services inflation, the red dashed line, has cooled largely in line with slower wage growth. Housing services inflation, the purple dotted line, remains somewhat elevated, but I expect more progress in that category as the earlier slowing in growth of rents for new tenants feeds through into growth of average rents.6 With supply and demand conditions having moved into better balance, wage growth slowing to a more sustainable pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, I see a path for inflation to continue its progress toward our longer-run goal. While the easing of overall inflation in recent years has been encouraging, the fact is that it remains above our 2 percent objective. Monthly inflation readings tend to be volatile, consistent with the bumpy path I described, but the 12-month readings have held in a fairly consistent range somewhat above our target over the second half of last year. Monetary Policy In the current environment, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my projections. As I have already mentioned, there have been notable recent instances where forecasters have been surprised. That said, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and I am attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate. That better balanced position is partly a result of the monetary policy actions over the past few years, which I will review briefly. As you can see in figure 8, the FOMC responded to elevated inflation by raising the policy rate 5-14 percentage points over about 15 months, starting in March 2022, and then holding the rate at that restrictive level for more than a year. This contributed to inflation easing from a 40-year high to near current levels while maintaining a solid labor market. That outcome was historically unusual but greatly welcomed. By September of last year, I had growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market could be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. The FOMC reduced the federal funds rate by a full percentage point over the course of our final three meetings last year. As a result of those actions, our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive than it was when we began lowering the federal funds rate. Given current economic conditions specifically, inflation that remains modestly above our target and a labor market that is solid and my projections of future economic conditions, I voted last week to maintain our current policy stance. As long as the economy and labor market remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making further adjustments. Over the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance as the most likely outcome. That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance. In considering additional adjustments to the federal funds rate, I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As is always the case, monetary policy is not on a preset course. To that end, I could envision a range of scenarios for future policy. For example, if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. Alternatively, if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, it may be appropriate to reduce the policy rate more quickly. Our current stance of policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. As I conclude, I want to assure you that I am mindful that monetary policy decisions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. I highly value opportunities to visit places like Lafayette College and Easton to share my views, hear from you, and see how the economy is experienced firsthand in your community. I remain fully committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. Thank you.\",\n          \"January 09, 2025 Reflections on 2024: Monetary Policy, Economic Performance, and Lessons for Banking Regulation Governor Michelle W. Bowman At the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach, California Let me begin by recognizing the devastation caused by the fires in the Los Angeles area. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted and the first responders who are fighting to bring the fires under control. I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you today.1 I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the past year, on both the path of monetary policy and the economy and on how this past experience can inform the bank regulatory agenda as we look ahead to a new year. In light of the policy decisions at the last few Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, I will begin by providing some perspective on my votes and then discuss my current views on the economy and monetary policy. Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meetings At the September meeting last year, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 12 percentage point to 4-34 to 5 percent. Although I was unable to support such a large cut at that time, I did agree with the Committee's assessment that it was appropriate to begin the process of recalibrating policy to reflect the progress in both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market since the middle of 2023. My dissent favored a smaller initial cut to begin the recalibration process and was the first FOMC dissent by a Board member in nearly 20 years. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting that noted that moving the policy rate down too quickly would carry the risk of unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. In addition, since inflation continues to hover well above our 2 percent goal, there was a real risk that the Committee's large policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. At both our November and December meetings, the Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 14 percentage point, bringing it to 4-14 to 4-12 percent. I supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the Committee's final step in the policy recalibration phase. The target range now reflects 100 basis points of cuts since September, and the policy rate is now closer to my estimate of its neutral level, which is higher than before the pandemic. But given the lack of continued progress on lowering inflation and the ongoing strength in economic activity and in the labor market, I could have supported taking no action at the December meeting. Still, I am pleased that the post-meeting statement continued to reference a flexible and data-dependent approach for considering future policy adjustments. It is important that we remain focused on returning inflation to 2 percent. I expect that the coming months should bring clarity on the incoming administration's policies and the carry over of inflationary pressures from 2024, reflecting private spending decisions and an apparent faster spend-out of existing federal government appropriations in recent months. It will be very important to understand how these factors will affect economic activity and inflation going forward. The Economy Towards the End of 2024 and Risks to the Outlook The U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. However, core inflation remains elevated, and I continue to see upside risks to inflation. The rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have stalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation which excludes food and energy prices moved back up to 2.8 percent in October and November, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has stalled since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. Persistently elevated core inflation continues to reflect pressures on housing services prices, possibly due to an increase in demand for affordable housing amid an inelastic supply. It also appears to be originating from a few other major components in recent months, such as in goods and in services with imputed prices. Gross domestic product increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased in the third quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. The latest data suggest continued strength in consumer spending in the fourth quarter as retail sales and sales of light vehicles continued to rise appreciably. Post-election consumer sentiment appears to be improving, but it remains well below pre-pandemic levels likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services. The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains rebounded in November, following a temporary drag in October from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike. On balance, job gains averaged about 130,000 over those two months, a pace only slightly below the average gains in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate rose to a still low 4.2 percent in November, but it has moved sideways since July. While unemployment is notably higher than in 2023, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment, and we will receive the December employment report tomorrow. The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 had only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth remains indicative of a tight labor market and above the pace consistent with our inflation goal. The rise in the unemployment rate last year largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force took longer to find work, while layoffs remained low. Although there has been some cooling in labor demand and the labor force participation rate declined a bit further in November, the household survey may have failed to capture the usual seasonal hiring ahead of the holidays due to the unusually early survey week and the late Thanksgiving holiday. More concerningly, the labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to accurately account for other influences. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret the monthly data from the payroll and household surveys. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases. Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to shocks, including labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, namely in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. The potential release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could also present inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it is not my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall. The Path Forward Looking ahead, we should be cautious in considering changes to the policy rate as we move toward a more neutral setting. Future actions should be based on a careful assessment of ongoing and sustained progress in achieving our goals, and we must be clear in our communication about how further changes are intended to affect economic conditions. We should also refrain from prejudging the incoming administration's future policies. Instead, we should wait for more clarity and then seek to understand the effects on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. I also continue to be concerned that the current stance of policy may not be as restrictive as others may see it. Given the ongoing strength in the economy, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are providing meaningful restraint. With equity prices more than 20 percent higher than a year ago, easier financial conditions may be contributing to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In fact, concerns about inflation risks seem to partly explain the recent notable increase in the 10-year Treasury yield back to values last seen in the spring of 2024. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy. Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our next meeting later this month, we will have seen new reports on consumer and producer price inflation. In addition to closely watching the incoming data and broader financial conditions, I will continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. It is also important to clearly explain how we consider progress in meeting our inflation and employment goals in our policy deliberations. Restoring price stability is essential for fostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term. Approach to Bank Regulatory Policy Turning to banking, I will start by sharing my thoughts on bank supervision and regulation. This year will see a transition in leadership at the banking agencies, and I expect that this will translate into a shift in priorities and approach. I am optimistic that by working collaboratively to focus on our statutory mandates, the banking agencies can improve how we fulfill our responsibilities in a fair, efficient, and accountable way. Adopting a more pragmatic approach to policymaking, one that imposes discipline in the exercise of the extensive powers and important responsibilities granted by Congress, would be most effective.2 Public debates about the bank regulatory framework routinely focus on whether regulators are being \\\"hard enough\\\" on banks, or whether the framework is too \\\"lenient.\\\" Framing the debate this way suggests a binary approach that ignores the known tradeoffs in any regulatory action like raising capital requirements or downgrading a bank's management rating for minor issues to show \\\"toughness.\\\" This approach interprets a rational prioritization of regulatory matters as being too bank friendly. While policy views may differ, policy debates should not misinterpret the dynamic of how banks and regulators should operate. In short, bank regulation and supervision need not be an adversarial system, with banks and regulators acting in opposition. Rather, banks and regulators often have the shared goal of a banking system that is safe, sound, and effective, with each serving an important role in furthering these objectives. As we move away from this type of binary thinking, that leaves the question of how regulators can best accomplish their statutory objectives. As a starting point, we must identify the objectives we are trying to achieve. In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve has the important responsibility of promoting the safe and sound operation of individual banks and the stability of the broader financial system. In many cases, these goals are complementary. When individual banks operate in a safe and sound manner, the banking system generally promotes the stability of the U.S. financial system. Of course, these objectives require a degree of balance if we want the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and facilitate economic growth. When we promote safety and soundness for example by raising capital requirements that has an effect on the aggregate lending capacity of the banking system and the availability of credit, particularly for less qualified borrowers. We must approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. We have the same responsibility to understand and appreciate the tradeoffs when we exercise our supervisory authority. I am optimistic about the future of banking in the United States and believe that the banking regulators can support the banking system by adopting a more pragmatic approach. While this is a non-exclusive list, I continue to believe the areas that we should focus on should include (1) prioritizing safety and soundness, (2) renewing our commitment to regulatory tailoring, and (3) increasing transparency.3 Prioritization of Safety and Soundness In 2024, bank regulators were still operating under the shadow of the 2023 bank failures, particularly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The risks facing SVB interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer base of the bank have long been important issues that have been prioritized during examinations. At its root, SVB's failure exposed significant flaws not only in the bank's management but also in the approach to oversight and supervision. As we approach regulatory and supervisory reform from the perspective of pragmatism, we need to take a close look at what went wrong and what could be fixed. Regulatory tools to improve management are imperfect and may be limited in their effectiveness before a bank has failed, but we have great latitude to modify our approach to supervision. One pragmatic change would be to prioritize safety and soundness and deprioritize matters that are not essential to or that are tangential to our statutory obligations. After SVB's failure, we saw a wide range of regulatory proposals. These have included substantial increases in bank capital requirements and pushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms. They have also included finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound firms and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks. Many of these proposals have targeted concerns well beyond remediating issues identified during the 2023 banking stress but have been justified in a generic way at least in part as a \\\"response\\\" to the failure of SVB. In many cases, the nexus between a proposed reform and how that reform would remediate any of the underlying issues that caused the failure of SVB or caused stress in the broader banking system is not clearly articulated. When the agencies pursue reforms, it is critical that the problem is clearly identified and that an explanation is given for how each proposal would address the problem. We should not characterize all reforms as \\\"crisis response\\\" actions, as doing so does not relieve us of the responsibility to analyze and justify the tradeoffs and alternatives of any particular measure. There is substantial room for agreement and consensus. We all want a banking system that can effectively provide credit, including to underserved consumers and businesses. We all want a banking system that is resilient in the face of changing economic conditions. We all want a banking system in which banks are free to experiment and innovate to better serve their customers. And we all want a banking system in which banks are held to high but economically reasonable standards in terms of capital, risk management and compliance. The process of any reform or change to the bank regulatory framework should begin with an identification of the problem, followed by an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency's statutory authorities, and an evaluation of whether targeted changes could result in improvements, remediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements. The resulting framework will better promote safety and soundness in a more durable and consistent way over time, while also continuing to support economic growth. Renewed Commitment to Tailoring Like you, I firmly believe in the virtues of tailoring not only as a statutory responsibility but as a key to forming sensible and effective bank regulatory policy.4 Tailoring can help ensure regulators focus on the most critical risks over time and avoid the over-allocation of resources or imposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve has not only statutory responsibilities established by Congress, but a responsibility to use our resources efficiently and effectively in the execution of our duties. Over the past two years, we have seen proposals that would materially reduce the tailoring of regulatory requirements, particularly as it relates to capital (the so-called Basel III \\\"endgame\\\" reforms) and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with over $100 billion in assets. Both proposals raise significant policy questions as to whether the costs are justified by the benefits questions not sufficiently addressed in the proposals and pose significant risks of unintended consequences. Essentially, this type of approach to capital \\\"flattens\\\" requirements across large banks. And coupled with other potential reforms to liquidity and funding requirements, this approach could lead to substantial industry consolidation as medium-sized banks weigh the benefits and costs to comply with an aggregate set of requirements more suitable for the largest banks. We should be cautious of these types of piecemeal regulatory proposals and instead think more holistically about the aggregate impacts as part of our process. Tailoring also plays an important role in supervision, an area that historically has differentiated expectations for firms based on size, business model, risk profile, and complexity. These criteria provide a reasonable basis to take a different approach based on the unique characteristics of each bank, and as banks shift in size and evolve in business model and risk, it is appropriate to recalibrate expectations. However, I see a growing risk that under the veil of supervision, there has been an erosion of a risk-based approach, and effectively a \\\"push-down\\\" of regulatory requirements designed and calibrated for larger firms to apply to smaller firms. I continue to believe that tailoring should be a central tenet of our regulatory and supervisory approach and framework and believe that we must renew our commitment to this philosophy going forward. I am confident that going forward, regulators will return to regulatory tailoring, particularly for community banks with straightforward business models. Increasing Transparency Regulators should operate in a transparent way and carefully and meticulously follow administrative procedures when making revisions to the regulatory framework. We should take a similar approach to shifts in supervisory focus. Doing so promotes trust and accountability to the public and should be integral to the important work we do promoting the safe and sound operation of the banking system and financial stability. Transparency also promotes innovation in the financial system by enabling banks to understand how to engage in new activities. This is especially important as digital assets and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the financial system. A deliberate, transparent, and fact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives helps us \\\"show our work,\\\" that we are focused on pursuing our policy goals, and are avoiding straying into political concerns outside of statutory purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit picking winners and losers or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination. Transparency promotes fairness, as regulated entities and the public can better understand why and how our actions further our goals. When we identify areas that suffer from a lack of transparency, we should act promptly to address those concerns. Take, for example, the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress testing process. On December 23, the Fed announced that it would soon seek public comment on \\\"significant changes\\\" to the stress testing process designed to improve transparency of the tests and reduce volatility of the resulting stress capital buffers that apply to large financial institutions.5 Given my longstanding support for revisiting the stress testing framework to promote transparency and reduce volatility, I am pleased with this development.6 Transparency can lead to better public engagement and outcomes and should be a central part of the regulatory and supervisory approach, even when not legally mandated, such as in supervision. Supervision involves examiners probing bank operations and assessing a bank's approach to risk and risk management. Much of this information is confidential and commercially sensitive and, therefore, not available to the public or released without risking some degree of harm to the institution. But the confidential nature and approach to supervision tends to result in a wide range of information being categorized as confidential supervisory information (CSI) and subject to restrictions on sharing. This information ends up being shielded from public scrutiny and becomes a barrier to banks engaging in discussion with peers and other regulators to better understand supervisory expectations. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet changes in supervisory expectations often arise in the course of an ongoing examination. As a result, the ability of a financial institution to be proactive to work to meet any new expectations is impossible until they have received supervisory feedback, often in the form of a supervisory finding or matter requiring attention or, in extreme cases, in a formal or informal supervisory action. I am not suggesting that there are always simple solutions to improve transparency, and certainly it is appropriate that much of the information developed in the supervisory process remains shielded as confidential supervisory information. But regulators must also acknowledge the new world in which we operate, one in which administrative law increasingly demands greater transparency and accountability to act as a check on regulatory overreach. Closing Thoughts Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the economy and bank regulatory matters with you today. In the coming months, I look forward to seeing the impacts of the new administration's policies on the economy and assessing how monetary policy should respond going forward. Today, the U.S. economy begins the new year on a strong footing, with still elevated inflation and a solid labor market. The new year brings an opportunity to reflect on the experience and lessons learned in the past few years and to take a critical look at improving the bank regulatory framework, including both supervision and regulation. And while I have laid out a few broad areas that I think deserve special attention focusing on safety and soundness, renewing our commitment to tailoring, and improving transparency my hope is that the steps we take to improve the regulatory framework in the future focus on pragmatism as a guiding principle.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"rise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

References for this speech can be found on the US Federal Reserve Systems's website. I am honored to participate in this tribute to Otmar Issing. I have known and admired Otmar for some time. It has been a source of great pride that he has considered me a worthy intellectual sparing partner over the years. From the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the restaurants of Frankfurt and at many conferences in between, we have challenged each other to state our assumptions, examine the evidence, and adjust our conclusions accordingly. I have derived enormous benefit from that give-and-take-a sentiment, I am sure, that many others in this room share. I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late-namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy. Otmar and I have debated this issue on many occasions, and these discussions-together with recent research carried out at the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and elsewhere-have been both challenging and stimulating. The preparation of this talk has afforded me a welcome opportunity to reexamine my thinking on this subject. So, today, I will review the arguments and the evidence as I see them and draw out the conclusions to which I am currently led. At the outset, let me stress that I will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Most fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation. But many argue that pronounced booms and busts in asset markets are another matter, especially if actual valuations appear to be misaligned with fundamentals. What should a central bank do when it suspects it faces a major speculative event-one that might be large enough to threaten economic stability when it unwinds? To help frame the discussion, I will focus on two different strategies that have been proposed for dealing with market bubbles. The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy-calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years. Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term. Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process. Following this strategy does not imply that policymakers ignore the expected future evolution of speculative activity. If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations. Practically speaking, however, I view our ability to act on such suspicions as limited given how little we know about the dynamics of speculative episodes. Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices-indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation. It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings. The second strategy, by comparison, is more activist and attempts to damp speculative activity directly. It was described at length in \\\"Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy,\\\" an article published by the ECB last year. I quote from the article: \\\"This approach amounts to a cautious policy of 'leaning against the wind' of an incipient bubble. The central bank would adopt a somewhat tighter policy stance in the face of an inflating asset market than it would otherwise allow if confronted with a similar macroeconomic outlook under more normal market conditions. . . . It would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future.\\\" Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble. Thus, the strategy seeks to trade off the near-certainty of worse macroeconomic performance today for the chance of disproportionally better performance in the future, on the theory that the repercussions of a major market correction could be highly nonlinear. But the extra-action proposal is by no means a bold call for central banks to prick market bubbles. As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession. Rather, the extra-action strategy is intended only to provide some limited insurance against the possibility of highly adverse events occurring down the road. I will be talking at length about the differences between the two strategies, but I must stress up front how much they have in common. Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework. Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies. At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level. Of course, we may not be prepared to write down a specific loss function and say, \\\"There, that's what I'm minimizing.\\\" But our deliberative processes and our actions seem broadly consistent with that characterization of the general problem. This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area. Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well. We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is marketdetermined and easily liquified. Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending. Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services. Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending. In cases of sharply falling market valuations, these adverse credit-channel effects may even be exacerbated by the deteriorating health of banks and other financial institutions. In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time. Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts. In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass. While no one uses formal Bayesian methods to solve this difficult problem, I think most policymakers do engage in at least an informal weighing of the various possibilities and their implications when setting policy. Now let me turn from areas of agreement to more contentious issues, ones that have a strong bearing on the relative merits of the two strategies. As the ECB article notes, extra action is often seen as a type of insurance. And as with any insurance policy, before you buy you have to ask whether the expected benefits outweigh the costs. As I see it, extra action pays only if three tough conditions are met. First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, there must be a fairly high probability that a modestly tighter policy will help to check the further expansion of speculative activity. And finally, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from a less expansive bubble must be sizable. You may be thinking that, in stating the three conditions, I have slanted the case with such phrases as \\\"reasonable confidence\\\" and \\\"fairly high probability.\\\" But stick with me, and I hope to persuade you that these probabilistic qualifiers are needed to judge the merits of extra action. For the moment, let me set aside the first condition and assume that central banks can distinguish an emerging bubble from improving fundamentals at an early stage. What about the other two conditions? Should we presume that a limited application of restrictive policy would materially restrain the speculative boom and make its eventual unwinding less disruptive for the overall economy? Consider the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-to-late 1990s. The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits-fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices. How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future. In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals. But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies. At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects. In general, we have a very poor understanding of the forces driving speculative bubbles and the role played by monetary policy. In fact, we cannot rule out perverse effects. Again, consider the U.S. experience of the late 1990s. When the FOMC tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell-perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained. Since mid-2004, we have seen a marked decline in bond-term premiums, even as the funds rate has risen steadily. These episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction. However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble. Even then, with the second condition now met, the third condition might not hold: The expected improvement in future macroeconomic performance from moderating the bubble's expansion may not be enough to more than offset the upfront costs of extra action. To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future. Admittedly, if the worst-outcome scenario associated with an unchecked bubble is judged sufficiently dire and if the scenario is not seen as too improbable, then a risk-averse policymaker might regard the expected return from extra action insurance as worth its upfront cost. However, our confidence in such an assessment would seem to hinge on believing that the effects of market corrections could be markedly nonlinear. Proponents of extra action often cite an increased risk of severe financial distress as a potential source of such effects. However, without the onset of deflation, how large is this risk? In recent history, the health of the U.S. financial system remained solid after the collapse of the high-tech boom, despite the bankruptcy of dozens of telecom and dot-com firms, the loss of more than $\\\\$ 8$ trillion in stock market wealth, and stress in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Moreover, the financial sectors of most other developed economies also weathered the worldwide drop in corporate equity values fairly well. Of course, the nonlinear risks associated with a collapsing bubble may depend on the initial health of the financial system, and under some circumstances we could be worried about the potential for significant financial distress to accompany the bursting of a bubble, should that bubble expand further. Even in such cases, however, I wonder whether good prudential supervision in advance and prompt action to clean up any lingering structural problems afterward would not be better ways to deal with this possibility. Certainly, closer oversight of banking systems during the 1980s, including the United States, would have left many economies in a stronger position during the early 1990s. This lesson has been absorbed by supervisory authorities around the world, as evidenced by our successful efforts to strengthen bank capital and our financial systems. I do agree that market corrections can have profoundly adverse consequences if they lead to deflation, as illustrated by the United States after the 1929 stock market crash and the more recent experience of Japan. But it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses. In Japan, deflation could probably have been avoided if the initial monetary response to the slump in real estate and stock market values had been more aggressive; in addition, macroeconomic performance would have been better if the government had dealt more promptly with the structural problems of the banking sector. As for the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve actually worsened the situation by allowing the money supply to contract sharply in 1930 and 1931, after unwisely attempting to prick the stock market bubble in the first place. Rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound. By doing so, policymakers should be able to avoid the severe nonlinear dynamics of deflation. Proponents of extra action often argue that it should reduce the risk of hitting the zero bound, but we should recognize that under some circumstances extra action may actually exacerbate the problem. To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts. Now the central bank contemplates taking extra action. In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small. In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand. With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts. Under these conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expected economic performance, not improve it. Another purported benefit of extra action is that, by raising the cost of capital to firms and households, it helps reduce overinvestment fostered during speculative booms, thereby making it easier for the economy to recover after the bubble collapses. However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the macroeconomic importance of such capital mis-allocation. True, the U.S. high-tech boom led to overinvestment in some sectors, wasting resources and creating lingering difficulties while capital overhangs were eliminated. But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years. Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals. Thus, mitigating capital misallocation in one sector would have created capital misallocations elsewhere, making the assessment of the net gain from extra action difficult. And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation. Now I would like to return to the first condition, the one I sidestepped a few minutes ago--the question of identifying market bubbles in a timely fashion. The EOB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate. For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain. Under extra action, mistakenly identifying a bubble has significant costs. By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose. Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses. But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time. And the mistaken call would have reduced welfare by needlessly inducing fluctuations in the macroeconomy. Timing is also an issue. Let us suppose that the evidence is so compelling that policymakers become fairly confident that valuations are excessively rich. Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability. The market correction could occur with policy in a tighter position but before extra action had enough time to materially influence speculative activity. Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits. Such talk might do some good by prompting investors to stop and rethink their assumptions. And talk by itself should not do much lasting harm even if valuations turn out to be justified--provided, however, that words are not seen as precursors to action under circumstances in which conventional policy would still be the best approach. To wrap up this critique, I summarize as follows: If we can identify bubbles quickly and accurately, are reasonably confident that tighter policy would materially check their expansion, and believe that severe market corrections have significant non-linear adverse effects on the economy, then extra action may well be merited. But if even one of these tough conditions is not met, then extra action would be more likely to lead to worse macroeconomic performance over time than that achievable with conventional policies that deal expeditiously with the effects of the unwinding of the bubbles when they occur. For my part, I am dubious that any central banker knows enough about the economy to overcome these hurdles. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances, or perhaps at some point in the future when our understanding of asset markets and the economy has increased, such a course of action would be appropriate. Proponents of extra action have their own bones to pick with the conventional strategy, especially as it relates to the alleged asymmetric nature of the policy's response to asset market booms and busts. In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC's actions over the past twenty years, the Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems. This argument strikes me as a misreading of history. U.S. monetary policy has responded symmetrically to the implications of asset-price movements for actual and projected developments in output and inflation, consistent with its mandate. The most convincing evidence for this statement can be found in the results: Interest rates have been consistent with underlying inflation remaining reasonably stable for some time now, accompanied by relatively mild fluctuations in real activity. Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk. Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a \\\"Greenspan put,\\\" stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy. Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were. The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions. Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves. Ironically, one can argue that extra action may pose a more significant risk of moral hazard. It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some \\\"appropriate\\\" level. How does this strategy play out if a central bank takes extra action and speculative activity continues unabated or even intensifies? Do policymakers raise rates even further above levels consistent with conventional policy and, if so, at what consequences for the economy? And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices? If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase? My remarks today have been intended as a salute to Otmar and to all the valuable contributions he has made over the years to my thinking and to that of policymakers around the world. Otmar, you have taught me much about intellectual rigor in support of central bank contributions to economic welfareand about friendship. Weighing the relative merits of extra action and conventional policy is not easy and requires a nuanced interpretation of the arguments and the evidence, as well as some hard thinking. Otmar and his colleagues have done this in advancing the case for extra action, and by so doing they have given me a good intellectual workout--and Otmar, I thank you for that. I hope my response has provided a good workout in return. I look forward to continuing the debate and especially the friendship for many years to come.\",\n          \"Interview with Mr Beno\\u00eet Coeur\\u00e9, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Delo, conducted by Mr Miha Jenko and published on 15 February 2014. Beno\\u00eet C\\u0153ur\\u00e9: Over the last 16 months, Slovenia has been through a very difficult period, with many serious challenges both from an economic and also from a financial standpoint. The Slovenian authorities have acknowledged and understood the challenges and have been addressing them in a systematic and serious way. The first appropriate and important steps have been taken, in particular when it comes to the restructuring of the banking sector. By completing the asset quality review and the stress tests they have reached a milestone, allowing for the restructuring of the banking system. But there remains a lot to be done. Both the Slovenian government and Banka Slovenije have a very good understanding of what has to be done. This relates to three key issues. The first is financial sector restructuring. This is well advanced. The asset quality review and the stress tests have been important and have been done in a serious and professional way, but this is only the first step. From now on you need a comprehensive reform of the banking system as part of a broader strategy for the entire economy. In this respect there are quite a few further steps to be taken. Second, there is the fiscal dimension, where you need to bring down the fiscal deficit, but it is also very important to bring down the public debt. In this respect, Slovenia must observe the recommendations issued by the European Commission regarding the reduction of the structural deficit. This fiscal effort should be aimed towards a visible reduction in the debt level. And the third aspect is obviously economic reform and improving the efficiency of the economy. No other effort will be successful if the economy does not become more efficient. Yes, the IMF has also warned Slovenia in its latest report about the risk of rapidly increasing public debt which could soon go beyond the hard-to-manage level of 85\\\\%. What are the necessary steps to reduce this risk of unmanageable public debt and high interest rate costs? One of the key policy actions is privatisation, which can be very useful both to improve the efficiency of the companies and banks and also to reduce Slovenia's debt level. Slovenian banks were subject recently to a very strict and a very conservative review by auditing companies Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman. In the end, there was the impression that we are forced to apply the most extreme, the most pessimistic and the most costly scenario as calculated by Oliver Wyman. Do you agree? I don't want to pass a judgement on the stress test itself which was done by the Slovenian authorities. In principle we are in favour of a strict approach to the stress tests. It is important to be on the safe side, to be prepared for the future and it is important that the banks are sound again so that they can lend to companies. So recapitalising banks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment in the future, so that banks can extend new loans to the economy. Slovenia has to address its banking legacy issues and be on the safe side. Are you also going to support such a strict, conservative approach this year when 128 key European banks will be analysed? Are these banks going to be examined as rigorously as ours? Absolutely, it will be the same philosophy. We will discuss all the parameters with the 18 supervisors - the so-called \\\"national competent authorities\\\" of the 18 euro area countries - within the ECB's new Supervisory Board, which met for the first time on 30 January. This will be the place where all the assumptions, parameters and choices will be discussed. This will be the first important contribution made by the Single Supervisory Mechanism to the euro area. The principles will be the same and they will be very strict, to make sure that we know everything about the situation of the banks this time - and to be sure that measures are taken to prepare for the future. Several critical reviews of the Oliver Wyman financial consultancy appeared recently in the foreign press. Why has the ECB decided to use Oliver Wyman, of all companies, to carry out such a demanding task and what were the selection criteria? There was an open, competitive selection process and Oliver Wyman came first. Taxpayers in Slovenia have paid over $\\u20ac 3$ billion, nearly 9\\\\% of GDP, for the recapitalisation of troubled state-owned banks alone. Banks are now full of capital. But on the other hand they are not lending money to companies for their working capital and investments. How do you see this controversy? Part of the explanation has to do with the weakness of aggregate demand not only in Slovenia but also across the euro area. Slovenia is a very open economy, selling a lot to European markets. The overall weakness of growth in the euro area also weighs on Slovenia. Now, it is true that the low level of ECB rates today translates very slowly to the real economy. This is happening in many countries and it is not specific to Slovenia. It will improve over time as we see convergence in the euro area and as we see reforms being implemented in the countries. And this you can already see taking place in Slovenia in the decrease in yields on the sovereign bond market. There has been a significant improvement in the long-term interest rates on bond markets. Slovenia is one of the best performers in the euro area in terms of decreasing bond yields, so that's a sign that convergence is taking place. It takes time to feed into the real economy but it will happen; things are going in the right direction. I think the priority currently is not really the Keynesian one. In Slovenia, the priority is to make the economy more efficient, both in the private sector and in the public sector. This also means that some companies should be moved from the public sector to the private sector through privatisation. This will happen and it will also benefit the debt level. Some enterprises will remain in the public sector - but their efficiency must also be improved. All the efforts that are being made today by the government and by Banka Slovenije to restore the soundness of the banking system are not going to achieve their goals, meaning to support growth and employment, if the economy does not work better. It is good to inject capital into banks, but if banks are facing projects that are not profitable they will be creating bad loans and make losses and the capital will be burnt. So it is very important that, alongside the restructuring and recapitalisation of banks, efforts are made to restructure the economy and to make it more profitable. That is also the recommendation of the European Commission to all countries and in particular to Slovenia in the so-called Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. It is important that this is respected. Haircutting the subordinated debt in Slovenian banks attracted a lot of public attention and even anger in recent months in Slovenia. Why was it necessary to perform this haircut in Slovenia, but not, for instance, in Ireland or other countries? This is not specific to Slovenia. Europe has learned the lessons from the past crises and has adopted a principle of responsibility for investors in bank bonds. All investors who put their money in these bonds have to know that they will be part of the effort if anything bad happens because bonds are an investment, not a deposit. These are the bail-in rules that have been decided by the European authorities and are intended to protect taxpayers, who should not be responsible for the situation of banks. When saving a bank, taxpayers should come last, with shareholders coming first, followed by bond owners. This distribution of responsibilities is now clear. This is not a decision of the ECB, it is a decision of the European Council and the Commission, but one that we support. True, but the decision is very recent and people didn't know before that something like that could happen at all. Slovenia is not the first case. It has already happened in Spain, for instance. But it's a change in the regime, with the aim that taxpayers and depositors are better protected and are not liable for the errors committed by banks. The BAMC had a good start. It has built up expertise and human capital, started operating and has already been receiving a first batch of bad loans. It now needs to continue its work and to receive the next instalment of bad assets, subject to the authorisation by the European Commission. Secondly, it needs to continue building up the institution itself so that it is credible and independent. It is not only about restructuring the banking sector but also about making the Slovenian economy function better. Bad loans are loans to the economy. For this reason, the BAMC should take decisions that are in the interest of Slovenian taxpayers and of the Slovenian people. It should keep resisting vested interests. For this purpose it has to be independent and in this way it will best protect the interests of taxpayers and workers in Slovenia. The good news is that Moody's has just increased the ratings of the recently recapitalised Slovenian banks. What should be done now by these banks to ensure further improvement of their ratings so that they can improve their access to funding and extend loans on favourable conditions? Beyond the ratings, what matters for Slovenia is the renewed trust of financial markets and investors, and the ultimate goal would be for these banks to be able to diversify their funding sources in the market, which would make them more resilient, and in turn support the Slovenian economy. Their objective should be to access to stable funding in financial markets. Banks should now properly manage their loan books and make adequate provisions, if necessary. But ultimately what matters most will be profitable projects in the economy. And this does not depend so much on the banks but also on the government, which needs to ensure a more efficient public sector, and on reforming the economy so that it is more efficient and able to thrive in the European environment. The key to success, therefore, lies in the real economy, not in the financial sector. I agree. Slovenia's economy generates nearly 70\\\\% of GDP from exports. What is the ECB's assessment of our main trading partners, Germany, France, Austria and Italy? Could we expect more demand from these countries this year? Certainly demand in the largest European economies is steadily improving. This is obviously not enough, but growth is positive again and it is accelerating. All the recent signs from the economy across Europe suggest that this scenario is again taking place. It is a scenario of a slow but steadily improving growth, also in the larger European economies. So demand from these economies is picking up and improving, and should benefit smaller, very open economies such as Slovenia. So there is ground for optimism. The euro area is going in the right direction. Two years ago, maybe even one year ago we didn't have this direction, this steady and improving growth. Certainly it is not enough and everything should be done to prop it up - but it is very important to know what the direction is. So is the euro safe now after some very turbulent years when there was even speculation it might break up? Is the euro on the safe side now, out of the worst trouble? The euro is no longer being challenged as a project. This is an important achievement. European policy-makers have confirmed their commitment to the single currency project and to the integrity of the euro area and this has restored trust in the euro in international capital markets. This is why many international investors are now coming to the euro area - it's a sign of trust in the reform process here. That's good news. What remains very challenging is growth, which is too low, and it should be Europe's priority to support it not only in countries with adjustment programmes but also in all other euro area countries. This cannot be achieved through additional public spending but through additional investment. All countries have to restore a climate of confidence that will be conducive to investment, and this includes large economies such as Germany, France and Italy. According to the latest figures, the inflation rate in the euro area has dropped as low as $0.7 \\\\%$, the lowest level in years. How serious is the problem of deflation for the ECB? The Governing Council's assumption is that the rate of inflation will gradually increase towards our target of close to, but below, $2 \\\\%$. We are however closer to the area where inflation expectations could be altered and create downside risks to price stability. So we are very vigilant regarding risks to our baseline scenario, which envisages inflation slowly going back to $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. This is our primary mandate and we take it very seriously. At its last meeting, the Governing Council firmly reiterated our forward guidance, whereby we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. We remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation that is appropriate for the euro area economy, and will not hesitate to take further decisive action if required. Inflation being below $2 \\\\%$ and close to $2 \\\\%$ is the definition of price stability that the ECB has chosen. In the uncertain environment with the euro area in transition and the participating economies undergoing a lot of structural change, it is very important that the ECB sticks to its inflation objective and maintains its credibility as an anchor for the reform efforts in Europe. The reason why the $2 \\\\%$ number has been chosen is that this is a level that is neither too high nor too low. We know that inflation which is too high can be detrimental for the economy as it can lead to destabilising feedback loops, for instance, through wage settlements and price indexation, and ultimately erode trust in the currency. But very low inflation can also be destabilising. That's why inflation which is too low is also contrary to price stability as it can create a self-fulfilling spiral of expectations that prices will continue falling. That would discourage households from consuming and companies would stop investing. This is the definition of deflation. So we want to be in the safe area between high inflation and deflation, and below but close to $2 \\\\%$ is exactly the right level. Note that since 1998, when this number was chosen, most of the major central banks around the world have converged towards the same number: it has been adopted by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and most recently by the Bank of Japan. Such steadily increasing prices do not distort economic choices. My personal definition of price stability is a rate of inflation which does not distort economic behaviour. To come back to Slovenian issues: our authorities have taken the decision to avoid using the ESM funds, which also carry certain conditionality. Based on the philosophy that we will solve our problems by ourselves, we have also tried to sell bonds in the US market. What is your view of that? Would it be better for Slovenia to return to the euro market and issue euro-denominated bonds? After all, we are a euro area country. I don't have any advice to give to your finance minister. He certainly does what is in the best interest of Slovenian taxpayers. In the medium term, stable funding for the Slovenian budget would benefit from a mix of dollar issuance and euro issuance. But so far the funding strategy has been successful. The biggest opposition party in Slovenia has proposed changes in central bank legislation to allow a representative of the political opposition to attend sessions of the Governing Board of Banka Slovenije. Is this proposal in line with ECB policies? We are in the process of looking at that particular proposal but it is clear that in every euro area country, small or large, the independence of the national central bank has to be ensured. According to one estimate, the 128 largest European banks which will undergo the asset quality review and stress test this year will require up to $\\u20ac 500$ billion of additional capital. Is this a manageable amount? It is absolutely premature to comment on any number. We are at the start of the process, getting organised and collecting the data. Once these tests have been completed, will European taxpayers be on the safe side? Will they have any guarantee that such a banking crisis will never happen again? The best safeguard to make sure that the banking crisis doesn't happen again is tough supervision, which will be ensured through the Single Supervisory Mechanism that will start operating in November. This is the best protection. The ECB, as the single supervisor in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, will have to be tough. Together with the new banking rules, this will be the best way of preventing future crises. I very much believe that taxpayers are now much better protected than they were before the crisis, in particular thanks to the new bail-in rules that make sure that investors in banks will be the first to cover any losses. If any capital shortfall is identified by the ECB stress test and asset quality review, it will have to be covered first by the private sector. The ECB has had a very clear role since May 2010, when we were invited to join the troika and advise the European Commission on matters where we have specific expertise. Those are generally financial sector issues, the situation of banks and also the general macroeconomic balance. This has been our role, but otherwise all the decisions related to financial support to countries have been taken by the Eurogroup and by the countries themselves. The Eurogroup is the politically and democratically accountable authority. Key decisions can only be taken by authorities, or politicians who are accountable to their parliaments. Decisions on reforms in individual countries can only be taken by local governments under the scrutiny of national parliaments. The work of the troika has to be accountable to democratic institutions. The ECB can explain what it does in the troika, but we only act as an adviser. The ECB is this year moving to a beautiful new building in Frankfurt. How many people will work in the new building and what will change with the move? The ECB's new building is a long-term project. All of our staff, some 1600 people, except those in charge of banking supervision, will move to the new building. The new banking supervisory body within the ECB will be located in another building in the centre of Frankfurt because its staff have to be together. It is also good that the monetary policy part of the ECB and the supervisory part are separated, as they are two different functions. The Governing Council has confirmed its main scenario of a steady recovery, with inflation gradually moving back towards our policy objective of below, but close to, $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. As explained by President Draghi, we didn't see enough reasons for policy action at our last meeting. Over the next weeks and months, if risks to our main scenario materialise, we will be ready to act, consistent with our forward guidance.\",\n          \"Speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the \\\"Annual Danish Top Executive Summit 2013\\\", Copenhagen, 29 January 2013. It is a real pleasure for me to share some thoughts today with such a distinguished group of business leaders. It may strike you as somewhat paradoxical for a central banker to address such an audience in a conference where the main theme is innovative thinking. After all, central bankers have traditionally been stereotyped as conservative and, well, rather dull. I firmly believe, though, that in a constantly changing world, decision-makers need to develop and maintain a healthy degree of scepticism around whether their current strategies and practices remain fit-for-purpose. This holds for decision-makers in business as well as in the public policy domain. And it is particularly relevant for central bankers, who have shouldered large part of the responsibility to navigate the economy through a once-in-a-generation financial and economic crisis. In the first part of my remarks today I will contour some salient features of central banks' response to the crisis. But I am sure that everyone here today is more interested in the future than pondering on what has been done so far. Indeed, as the macroeconomic and business environment remains challenging, the calls for a rethinking of business models and strategic orientations become more forceful. This is also the case in the monetary policy-making arena, where new strategic aspects are being promoted and debated around the globe. In the second and main part of my remarks I would, therefore, like to focus on two examples of such \\\"innovative\\\" strategic thinking for monetary policy, assessing them from a euro area perspective. The first example concerns the objective of monetary policy. The second one refers to how policy is conducted to deliver the assigned objective. Prompted by the crisis, central bankers globally have thought openly and creatively. They designed and deployed a host of measures that went well beyond their traditional modus operandi. This reaction of central banks has clear parallels to the way business leaders confront challenges. To illustrate this, let me briefly outline how features of central banking practices correspond to the four themes that the organisers of this conference have laid out as relevant for addressing challenges in the corporate world. The first theme is strength. Central banks typically rely on financial markets to transmit their monetary policy intentions to the real economy. During the crisis, dysfunctional segments of financial markets threatened to weaken or completely suppress this process. Central banks addressed these market dislocations in a resolute way, thereby showcasing the strength of the instruments that are at their disposal. Second comes control. Ensuring that the expectations of firms and households regarding future inflation remain well-anchored is of the essence for keeping inflation in check. During the crisis, through words and deeds, central banks have strived to maintain these expectations under control. The third theme is horizon. The most obvious concept of horizon in the context of central banking is that of time-horizon. Both in normal times and in times of crisis, central bankers seek to maintain a medium-term horizon and thus avoid being overwhelmed by short-term considerations. At the same time, central banks have demonstrated a capacity to deploy crisis management measures within a very short time span, when this was necessary. The fourth and final theme of the conference was courage. Again this may sound paradoxical. Central bankers are proverbially prudent and risk averse. But there is a particular type of courage that they need to exhibit: the courage and firm character to stay the course and unwaveringly pursue the assigned mandate, when calls to serve other objectives can be increasingly loud. At the ECB, in particular, our response to the crisis has been two-pronged. The first element has been the swift reduction of our key policy rates to historically low levels in response to the emergence of downside risks to price stability. This is what is considered \\\"standard\\\" monetary policy action. The second element has entailed a host of measures to address dislocations in financial markets that were preventing the permissive monetary policy interest rates to be fully and evenly reflected in the lending conditions faced by households and firms across the euro area. These measures are typically referred to as \\\"non-standard\\\" and were intended to relieve liquidity and funding constraints in the banking sector, as well as unwarranted tail risks. This set of measures, therefore, serves to improve financing conditions over and above what can be achieved through reductions in the key ECB interest rates. In addressing the crisis we have been acutely aware of the need to strike a delicate balance between two sets of competing considerations. On the one hand, central banks were faced with the risk of a financial meltdown, which would have had profound implications for the real economy and which posed a serious threat to price stability. On the other hand, the resolute response of the central bank to the financial crisis relieves the pressure from other actors in the economy to measure up to their own responsibilities, correct the past unsustainable economic course and unwind excesses. This refers not only to governments but also to the private sector. In the past year we have seen significant progress in the European economic governance framework. These changes to the institutional architecture of the EU have been of great importance for restoring the appropriate incentives of the actors involved. Let me now turn to the discussion of \\\"innovative\\\" ideas on strategic aspects of monetary policy. Since the early 1980s, a broad consensus has emerged across advanced economies which has elevated price stability to the main - although not always the sole - objective of monetary policy. Indeed, through the fixed-exchange-rate policy for the krone vis-\\u00e0-vis the euro, Danmarks Nationalbank is effectively also among the central banks aiming at maintaining price stability. In most cases, the mandate for pursuing price stability has been operationalised by defining a numerical value for inflation that the central bank should aim to deliver. In advanced economies this value is low, typically within a narrow range around $2 \\\\%$. In the wake of the crisis, however, a number of pundits have called for an increase in the inflation rate that central banks should aim for. These calls have originated from diverse sources spanning academia, policy circles and financial markets. Proponents of this The rationale is that a higher inflation objective, if credible, would prompt firms and households to revise their expectations regarding future inflation upwards. By doing so, it would reduce further down real interest rates, which are not necessarily constrained by zero. As real - rather than nominal - interest rates matter for economic decisions such as investment and consumption, this change should promote economic activity. It is therefore argued that switching to a higher numerical aim for inflation will bring about a one-off accommodative effect when it is adopted. Moreover, it is claimed that it will also make it less likely in the future that nominal rates will become constrained by their lower bound. It may not surprise you to hear that I am very sceptical about this proposal, both in general terms and in the euro area context in particular. To explain my concerns, I shall step back for a moment and clarify an aspect of the ECB's monetary policy framework that is subtle, but in my view important. By contrast to many central banks around the world, the ECB does not practice inflation targeting. The ECB has been mandated by the Treaty (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) to maintain price stability over the medium term. The mandate itself does not entail a precise definition of what price stability means in practice. The Governing Council, therefore, decided to identify inflation values consistent with conditions of price stability. Price stability conditions do not necessarily entail stable prices, that is to say zero inflation. Inflation levels which are sufficiently contained to not interfere with economic choices are to be considered indicative of a stable monetary environment, and therefore of price stability. Inflation impinges on a large array of economic activities. For instance, it has an important effect on the way people take decisions about how to allocate resources across time. For example, a household's decision to consume today or instead save and consume in the future; a worker's decision to supply labour; or a firm's decision to invest. Moreover, inflation - especially if it is volatile - creates distortions in the information content of relative prices in the economy. This can lead to incorrect economic decisions if, for instance, firms wrongly interpret a general price increase as a signal of increased demand for their product. It also affects the frequency of changes in businesses' price tags and menus. Importantly, these effects lead to dead-weight losses and distortions in the allocation of resources and, therefore, to socially sub-optimal economic outcomes. The upshot is that the rate of inflation, above which distortions of economic decision-making start becoming material, is not a matter of policy preference, like an inflation target. Instead, it is a structural feature of the economy. It is linked to aspects such as contract and commercial pricing technologies; the tax and welfare system; and the demographic structure of the population, to name but a few. While these structural features of course can and indeed do change, they do so only very gradually and infrequently. Moreover, the direction and size of the effect of any such changes on the non-distortive inflation rate is not a priori clear. It needs to be thoroughly examined and conclusively proven. For surveys of the literature on the costs of inflation, see O. Issing, \\\"Why price stability?\\\", in: A.G. Herrero, V. Gaspar, L. Hoogduin, J. Morgan and B. Winkler (eds.), Why price stability?, First ECB Central Banking Conference, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2001 and G. Camba-Mendez, J.A. Garcia and D. Rodriguez Palenzuela, \\\"Relevant economic issues concerning the optimal rate of inflation\\\", in O. Issing (ed.), Background studies for the ECB's Evaluation of its Monetary Policy Strategy, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2003. Where does this leave us on the proposal to increase the numerical objective pursued by monetary policy? An inflation target can be changed to reflect shifting policy tastes and moving priorities. But a quantitative definition of price stability is a range of inflation values that can be qualified as unproblematic for economic decision-making. And this qualification is a factual statement, not a matter of tactical choice. Changing it on tactical grounds would be opportunistic and would harm the credibility of the central bank. For a central bank like the ECB, wedded to a range of inflation values that can be characterised as indicative of stable prices, a change to this range - and notably to its upper quantitative limit - is not conceivable barring analysis that convincingly argues for a wider range and larger values. A change not justified on these bases would create permanent damage to our ability to steer inflation expectations and contain inflation volatility. A loss of credibility can lead to an overshooting of inflation expectations. This would require a disproportionate withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation in the future to rein in inflation. Any initial boost to economic activity will therefore ultimately be more than reversed. Additional and unnecessary volatility in real activity would be the price to pay. In any case, it seems to me that the trade-off implied by this proposal is rather lopsided. Even if the central bank is successful in engineering precisely the intended permissive conditions as measured by a real interest rate decline, it is far from clear that this would indeed generate real effects even in the short-term. If, for instance, there are quantitative constraints in the availability of credit at play in the economy, the lower short-term real rates will fail to stimulate aggregate demand. Overall, therefore, one risks trading very uncertain gains - in terms of immediate policy accommodation - against rather certain costs - in terms of higher inflation, possibly for an indefinite period. Such risk-payoff structures are perfectly acceptable in the business world. Indeed taking calculated risks is often the mark of a successful business leader. For public policy, however, this strikes me as a deal that should not be made. But for some of the proponents of increasing the central bank's inflation objective this proposal is not motivated by a perceived need to stimulate aggregate demand when nominal interest rates are at zero or close to zero. Instead, they focus on another feature of the crisis: balance sheet adjustment in order to address the over-indebtedness problem. According to this argument, a higher inflation objective makes it less likely that the economy may get trapped in a destructive debt-deflation spiral of the type described by Irving Fisher. In the midst of the Great Depression, Fisher put forward a theory of economic crises that centred on the mutually reinforcing effects between over-indebtedness and deflation. According to this view, over-indebtedness beyond some point triggers distressed asset sales as debt is called in. This leads to abrupt deleveraging and a contraction of the amount of money in circulation. The destruction of money precipitates a fall in the general price level. Deflation in turn causes the real debt and interest burden to go up, thereby triggering a new bout of distressed asset sales and deleveraging and trapping the economy in a vicious circle. Deflation poses risks to the economy that - in some respects - are even more intractable than inflation. It is for this reason that the Governing Council's definition of price stability rules out negative inflation values. Moreover, the Governing Council's policy aim (within the range of positive inflation rates that are consistent with price stability) is sufficiently close to the upper bound of the range to stave off the risk that negative price shocks may unleash a self-reinforcing downward inflation spiral. But engineering financial repression in order to facilitate balance sheet adjustment would clearly violate the mandate to maintain price stability as a primary objective conferred upon the ECB by the Treaty. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the central bank's steering of inflation expectations as an illustration of the notion of control. Moreover, I mentioned that the steadfast pursuit of the central bank's mandate exemplifies the notion of courage. I am very sceptical whether increasing the numerical definition of price stability helps in either of these dimensions. Let me now turn to the second example of an innovative proposal for monetary policy that I would like to discuss today. Unlike the previous proposal, this one does not relate to the objective of the central bank. Instead, it focuses on how the central bank can actually achieve its assigned objective, when the chances that the objective will be hit diminish. As I already mentioned, central banks typically conduct monetary policy by steering nominal short-term interest rates. These are the rates over which they can exert significant influence through the monopoly supply of central bank reserves. It is, however, widely accepted that it is primarily long-term interest rates that matter for the main economic decisions that the central bank wants to influence. How is it then that monetary policy can have an impact on the economy? Well, one can think of long-term interest rates as comprising two elements: expectations regarding the future evolution of short-term rates; and premia. Premia relate to the compensation investors demand for holding on to an asset for a specific period of time (the term premium). Moreover, they relate to the compensation for risks, such as the possibility of incurring capital losses due to difficulties they may encounter when selling the asset back to the market before maturity and at short notice (the liquidity premium). Changes in the current policy rate are typically interpreted by markets to also signal changes for short-term rates in the future. That is, they affect market expectations for future short-term rates and therefore, long-term rates. In normal times, this signalling channel works well and market expectations tend to be in line with monetary policy makers' intended long-term rates. When, however, short-term nominal rates are at zero or close to zero, this signalling channel loses its potency. The risk is that long-term rates may drift away from the central bank's intended path, in which case financing conditions in the economy will not properly reflect the stance of monetary policy. Some academic economists have advocated that, particularly in such a situation, the central bank should engage in active communication regarding the future path of policy rates. If this commitment is sufficiently credible, it will be effective in steering expectations regarding future interest rates and so influence the first component of long-term interest rates to which I was referring before. This is turn, will allow the central bank to deliver accommodative financing conditions in the economy over a certain horizon. A number of central banks around the world - most recently including the US Federal Reserve - have adopted some version of this approach. But the decomposition of long-term rates I mentioned a few moments ago suggests that there is also another possible way for the central bank to deliver appropriate financing conditions in the economy. This second approach is to exert influence on the premia, to the extent that they are unwarranted and reflect dislocations in markets. I would argue that the assessment regarding which approach is more appropriate depends on the particular situation each monetary policy maker faces. The approach focusing on communication regarding the future path of short-term interest rates is in principle applicable to a situation where there is a need to provide general, across the board, stimulus to the economy. Moreover, it applies in currency areas where financing conditions are more or less homogeneous throughout segments of the financial market and of the currency space. By this I mean a situation in which following a reduction in the array of risk-free interest rates, firms or households with comparable characteristics experience a broadly similar decrease in the borrowing rates they are charged for finance. Despite the notable improvements recently, this by and large is not the situation we are facing in the euro area. Domestic financial conditions across euro area countries remain fragmented. The spreads that lenders apply over benchmark rates are very uneven and, in some countries, abnormally high, reflecting dysfunctional market dynamics. Moreover, there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate in the euro area. Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. Under these circumstances, it strikes me as far more appropriate to encourage conditions for a more even distribution of the very permissive liquidity provision that is in place. Engaging in promises regarding the future monetary policy stance would not be the most effective instrument for achieving this. Instead, we need to continue addressing the part of the premia in long-term rates in the euro area that is not warranted. But let me be clear, this does not mean that monetary policy instruments should be used to reduce credit spreads that reflect well-founded concerns regarding long-term debt sustainability and competitiveness. Is this alternative approach effective? In a nutshell I would say that the arsenal of the ECB's instruments for monetary policy implementation continues to be able to induce relaxation of conditions in term borrowing, when this is deemed necessary. In particular, the very long tenor of some of our refinancing operations combined with the full accommodation of banks' demand for such refinancing at the prevailing rate has proven to be very powerful. Indeed, this has been effective in lowering rates along the yield curve, without having to engage in commitments on the future stance of monetary policy to steer expectations. By providing security to our bank counterparties that central bank credit will remain in place for a sufficiently long horizon, we have acted on the liquidity premium component of term interest rates: the spread that remunerates banks lending in the inter-bank market for the risk that their borrowing counterpart may become illiquid and unable to honour the inter-bank credit contract at maturity. This added degree of comfort has encouraged market activity at decreasing term lending rates. But I do not want to imply that the approach that the ECB has followed thus far is free of pitfalls. For instance, the use of refinancing operations with a very long maturity results in an immediate expansion of the balance sheet when implemented. Such an expansion is not without challenges for central bank communication and for managing inflation expectations. Moreover, it has the unintended side-effect that it increases the encumbrance of banks' balance sheets. That is, it increases the share of bank assets that are already pledged as collateral, and thus unavailable to support the borrower's standing in additional credit operations. The share of bank assets that would be available to cover the claims of unsecured creditors in case of a default shrinks. This, in turn, amplifies the perceived loss given default of additional claimants and makes it more difficult for banks to access the unsecured money markets, which in normal times is the main market for marginal bank funding. We are fully aware of this risk and this is part of the reason that we have allowed for early repayment of our 3-year long-term refinancing operations. This way, when a counterparty judges that its chances of accessing market funding are being constrained by its use of ECB 3-year long-term refinancing operations, it can repay all or part of the amount borrowed earlier than its original maturity. In fact, tomorrow is the first opportunity to make use of the early repayment option. Euro area banks have taken this opportunity and have informed us that they will repay $\\u20ac 137$ billion of the slightly more than $\\u20ac 1$ trillion outstanding in such long-term operations. We will exert vigilance to ensure that - notwithstanding the legitimate decisions of individual banks to reduce their liabilities to the central bank - the overall liquidity conditions prevailing in the money market will remain consistent with the degree of accommodation that the current outlook for prices and real activity warrant. Whichever of the two approaches a central bank decides to use, it needs to be well appreciated that there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve. Delivering accommodative financing conditions and ample liquidity to the banking system has been necessary to avoid an abrupt deleveraging that could tip the economy into a destructive deflationary spiral. But parts of the banking system remain overstretched and this needs to be addressed in order to move decisively out of the crisis. Similarly, structural reforms need to be undertaken in order to restore the competitiveness of euro area economies. Only such reforms can deliver a lasting reversal of the fragmentation phenomena that the euro area has witnessed. And clearly neither of these tasks can be taken up by monetary policy. Let me conclude with a cautionary tale. Innovation is the quintessence of entrepreneurship and a cornerstone for economic growth and prosperity in market-based economies. But there can be innovations that create more problems than the ones they were originally conceived to address. I am reminded of the two mortal sins of economic policy-making that clearly transpire when reading Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's excellent book on financial crises: arrogance and ignorance. Transposing this insight to the discussion on monetary policy frameworks, I would say that it is dangerously arrogant to believe that one's current approach to monetary policy is perfect and no improvements or changes will ever be needed. Certainly, before the crisis, a certain degree of academic group thinking and central bank professional hubris bred a sense of accomplishment that proved exceedingly complacent and ultimately self-defeating. Looking forward, we should temper a tendency to self-complacency - if not arrogance - with the strength of thought and the courage of vision. But courage and vision should not entice us into hazardous experimentations. We should not be ignorant of the lessons that history has taught. And history has shown that inflation was permanently brought under control when the public's inflation expectations became safely anchored. This in turn occurred when central banks gained credibility regarding their determination to stabilise inflation. This credibility was hard-earned but can be eroded easily. It would be irresponsible to jeopardise it. As regards the ECB in particular, I am convinced that our existing monetary policy framework provides enough scope for instruments to continue addressing the crisis in a decisive and effective way. We remain attentive to possible shortcomings in our policy framework and to changes in the structure of the economy that would warrant revisiting aspects of this framework. At present, however, I see no compelling case for change.

Waller At Lectures of the Governor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, France Thank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of lectures from central bankers.1 I will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. But on this occasion, I thought it appropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges that OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we approach monetary policy and our other responsibilities. I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine quarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite this robust economic growth, the labor market softened over 2024, and employment is now near what I judge to be the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) maximum-employment objective. I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months. With regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023, progress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024. Our latest reading of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months ending in November. This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2 percent. This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy rate. However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate. Let me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal. First, as we saw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but disinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks. To tease out the underlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE prices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving down toward 2 percent over the course of the year. Second, the monthly reading for November came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in October. Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices, such as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly observed and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across all goods and services in the economy. These two categories represent about one-third of the core PCE basket. If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core PCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through November. I don't support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-market services, but I find it notable that imputed prices, rather than observed prices, were driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path. Finally, the higher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in January. This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers through March. Looking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times in recent years. In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of upward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year. Projections of the economic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely. If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy. Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted before we can seriously consider their effects. So what is my view? If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025. The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening. Based on the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median of policymakers' expected appropriate policy rate this year implies two 25 basis point cuts.2 But the range of views is quite large, from no cuts to as many as five cuts for different FOMC participants. As always, the extent of further easing will depend on what the data tell us about progress toward 2 percent inflation, but my bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate. Let me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame monetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond. Each of the issues I raise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in some places than others. I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so please don't take any signal from the order in which they are raised. I will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our targets for inflation. While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in most jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators of the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running persistently above target. Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD economies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls. I believe policy is still restrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have inflation at their targets going forward. This common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the common experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions before and during the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and forcefulness of policy responses. The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the result of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge varied across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown by research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.3 A common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of goods production and delivery.4 Shortages of key components and waves of COVID variants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist. Fortunately, these disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. That said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies volatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation. Another common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic. The extent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses during the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.5 Regardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to a doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger percentages in some places. Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still higher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many OECD members. Another recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in manufacturing. Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic, when consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods. But as businesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the swing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in manufacturing in OECD economies. This slide has been compounded by three other factors. First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the past couple of years raised capital costs in this sector. As monetary policy eases across countries, this effect may unwind. Also, higher energy costs after Russia's attack on Ukraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors. And lastly, China's push to reduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos has had a big impact across OECD economies. While the manufacturing sector is a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD countries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the prospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere. The extent and timing of tariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects. Overall, the evolution of manufacturing adds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers' outlooks. A short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among OECD countries is geopolitical risk. Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are elevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Today however, you certainly can't see much evidence for geopolitical risk affecting financial markets. But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge that central bankers will need to keep in mind. The outbreak of war in Europe and, more recently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as we have seen recently in Syria. It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect security, trade, and migration flows around the world. The fact that these conflicts have not affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn't mean they can't and won't. Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and economic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and employment.6 I expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to consider geopolitical risk in the medium term. The next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both shorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a \\\"rethink of globalization.\\\" For close to a decade now, many countries have been reexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor, and goods that was the norm over previous decades. Although global trade has not decreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more countries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening supply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs. This isn't simply the result of some failed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict. Rather, it has been a persistent and widespread trend that has been under way for some time. The presumption that the increasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would inevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was. At the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have, the \\\"end of globalization,\\\" because I don't believe that this will be the outcome. As I think about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this organization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I would say that globalization is not going away. What I do expect, however, is there will be more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the people we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer integration and the potential benefits. As these decisions by governments are made, central bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary policy and promoting financial stability. Another longer-term challenge involves demographic trends. What I mean here is the aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else. While this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for central bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices. In the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the population in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033. Aging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries. This is a slow-moving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement, employment and economic output fall. This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can affect consumption, investment and inflation. As aging populations sell accumulated assets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the latter potentially affecting the central bank's estimate of the neutral policy rate. There are mitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age, immigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers. Again, these demographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to monetary policy. Productivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been the subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year. According to one set of estimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative GDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares in other countries. Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is hard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.7 Having some understanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers thinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation. Central bankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly without igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased. Productivity growth also plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r. Higher productivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r for some policymakers and thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation or restrictiveness for policy.8 One way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to compare the United States to other OECD countries. While it is not particularly new for productivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some differences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the pandemic.9 First, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during COVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may have led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more productive. Second, during the acute U.S. labor shortages in 2022 and 2023, I heard numerous anecdotes that firms had to invest more in worker training to raise skill levels to what was necessary for positions. This raises labor productivity with a delay, and it may have been an important factor recently. Third, business creation is, by all evidence, easier in the United States, and new firms often are more productive than existing firms. There was a surge in U.S. business creation after COVID, which could reasonably have led to a more productive re-allocation of labor. There may have been other factors. I don't think that artificial intelligence (AI) was one of them. AI investment will take place over many years and most likely has not done much yet to add to productive capacity. While it is possible AI could increase longer-run productivity growth, that remains to be seen. But the other possible reasons the flexibility of labor rules, ease of business entry, barriers to innovation, lower regulatory hurdles would sound familiar to people attending OECD discussions a decade ago. The barriers to innovative risk-taking are probably lower and the rewards higher in the United States. So while I am skeptical that AI is already making significant contributions to productivity growth, I have little doubt that it will do so. AI and allied innovations in computing have the potential to bring productivity advances to high-skill labor-intensive services, akin to the way robotics transformed high-skill manufacturing. If such advances do occur, one challenge for governments will be fostering an economy in which those dislocated by such a shift can obtain new skills and find productive and meaningful employment. As ever, prudent regulation should be balanced with support for innovation that has the potential to deliver widespread improvements in living standards. But regulatory policy should not strangle innovation in its infancy. So, at the end of this list of challenges, how should central banks meet them? There will always be new challenges, but the right approach to monetary policy hasn't changed, nor should it. In every case, the answer begins with sticking to our mandates and resisting the temptation to go beyond them. We must closely monitor economic and financial conditions and look in every direction, and down the road, for emerging risks. In keeping to our mandates, we concede that seeing all these risks clearly is hard, so we need to remain focused. We also need to be nimble in responding to unfamiliar risks and be prepared to use our monetary policy tools in new ways to prepare for unprecedented challenges that may present themselves. When conditions are uncertain, as they often are, we must move deliberately but also be ready to act quickly and decisively when the situation demands it, as we did in subduing inflation. Effective monetary policy depends on clearly communicating our intentions so that the public will act on those intentions. That also requires credibility, and this is most effectively maintained when monetary policy decisions are made according to our mandates and in the longer-term interest of a healthy economy and stable financial system. Guided by these basic principles, I believe that central bankers are up to the considerable challenges of today, and those we will face in the years ahead.\",\n          \"February 04, 2025 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson At the Economics Department Special Lecture, Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania Thank you, Professor Smith. It is an honor to be speaking to you today here at Lafayette College.1 I am glad to have the opportunity to return to such a historically important place as Easton, Pennsylvania, and the Lehigh Valley. This area was part of this country's colonial beginnings, it was instrumental in the rising of the industrial age, and, as the home to Crayola, it very literally played a role in coloring how we see the world. Today, this region is leading the way forward with its many outstanding institutions of higher education, very prominently including, of course, Lafayette College. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views of appropriate monetary policy. This is a useful time to do that, as my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve's primary monetary policymaking body, held our first meeting of 2025 just last week. Overall, the U.S. economy is starting the year in a good position. I expect inflation's slow descent to continue, and I anticipate that economic growth and labor market conditions will remain solid. I have learned, however, that it is wise to be humble about my projections. There is always a great deal of uncertainty around any economic forecast, and currently we face additional uncertainties about the exact shape of government policies, as well as their economic implications. Last week, my FOMC colleagues and I discussed the latest economic developments and reviewed data that arrived since our previous policy meeting in December. At the conclusion of that meeting, I voted in support of the Committee's decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-14 to 4-12 percent. This decision was made in support of our goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. I remain focused on setting policy to achieve the dual-mandate goals given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices. Sound monetary policy and positive supply-side developments have contributed to the achievement of sustained economic growth in recent years, the return of low unemployment, and inflation moving sustainably toward our 2 percent objective. I remain committed to returning inflation to our target while sustaining the solid labor market. Now is an appropriate time to assess the path forward for the economy. I am happy to be here today to share my views with you. Economic Activity The U.S. economy appears to be maintaining its momentum after growing at a solid pace last year. Last year's growth was notable because many private forecasters in 2023 projected a significant downturn sometime in 2024.2 However, data over the past year painted a very different picture. GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to last week's data release.3 As you can see in figure 1, that extends a stretch of solid quarterly growth over the past couple of years. Shortly, when I discuss the labor market, I will say more related to the large swing in GDP growth in 2020 that stands out in this chart. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.5 percent, which is a modest slowing from the 3.2 percent growth in 2023. The economy has been benefiting from positive supply developments, including more workers joining the labor force and higher labor productivity. The resilience of American consumers is the driving force behind the solid economic growth seen in recent quarters. Household spending, adjusted for inflation, grew 3.2 percent in 2024, slightly stronger than in 2023. The consumer spending data we have received recently have surprised me to the upside. As you can see in figure 2, personal consumption increased at a faster pace each quarter last year. Nominal retail sales rose briskly in the second half of last year. Private-sector data are consistent with GDP figures. According to private surveys of businesses, activity in the services sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of all consumer spending, has been on a general upward trajectory since mid-2020.4 Elsewhere in the economy, growth has been less robust. Residential investment has been fairly flat over the past three quarters, and growth of business fixed investment cooled last year from its strong 2023 pace. Much of the equipment investment that did take place came from imports. Indeed, domestic manufacturing industrial production was flat last year. Overall, I see the economy as continuing to grow at a healthy pace this year, though I anticipate growth to be slightly lower than what we observed in 2024. Households and firms face an uncertain environment, and that tends to lower consumer spending and business investment. If consumer spending continues to grow at the same pace as it has in the past two years, however, that could cause me to revise up my outlook for overall economic growth. Labor Market Turning to employment, I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with conditions broadly returning to balance after a period of being overheated. It's helpful to step back and look at the labor market's path over the past five years. Looking at figure 3, you can see that the unemployment rate surged in early 2020, peaking at 14.8 percent in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold and a wide swath of the global economy was shutdown. The unemployment rate subsequently fell swiftly as the economy recovered. By April 2023, it touched 3.4 percent, a half-century low. At that point, many employers reported that they were struggling to fill openings. Then, over the latter part of 2023 and early 2024, the unemployment rate rose nearly a percentage point, an unusual pattern outside of a recession. As a policymaker, I took note of this rise when considering our dual-mandate objectives. Now, I have also taken note that the unemployment rate has effectively held steady since the middle of last year. I view that as a sign that downside risks in the labor market have abated. The latest jobs report showed that the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in December, the same reading as in June 2024.5 That is low by historical standards and close to estimates of the longer-run rate that is consistent with our employment mandate. In the three months ending in December, payrolls rose by an average of 170,000 jobs a month. While employment growth has eased somewhat from the early part of last year, the steady unemployment rate suggests that payroll gains have been sufficient to absorb new entrants to the labor market. The general moderation in hiring is consistent with other measures showing that the demand for labor has come into better balance with the supply of workers. Looking at figure 4, you can see that as of November, there were 1.2 job openings for every unemployed person seeking work. That ratio is down from 2.0 in 2022, when the labor market was overheated. Also notice that the current vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is just a little below its value before the pandemic took hold. And while hiring has eased from the pace in 2023, layoffs have not increased. As you can see in figure 5, the number of Americans seeking first-time unemployment benefits has trended at historically low levels for the past three years. Consistent with a moderation in hiring and a steady unemployment rate, workers' wage gains have slowed from when the labor market was overheated. Still, the pace of increase in average hourly earnings has been healthy, increasing 3.9 percent during the 12 months ending in December, and shows that, on average, worker pay has grown at a faster rate than the rate of inflation. Looking broadly across the past several months, I see a labor market that is in solid condition and not a source of significant inflationary pressure. While the downside risks of a rapidly weakening labor market appear to have lessened, I expect some further softening that could cause the unemployment rate to edge just slightly higher this year but stay in a range consistent with recent readings. Inflation Thinking about the other component of our dual mandate, inflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent objective. Inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.2 percent in June 2022. Looking at the blue line in figure 6, you can see that it has since come down to 2.6 percent as of this past December. Economists also pay close attention to core inflation, which excludes often volatile food and energy costs. That core PCE inflation figure, shown by the red dashed line, peaked at 5.6 percent in 2022. By December 2024, it had eased to 2.8 percent. Annualized inflation over the past three months has been closer to our 2 percent objective. As you can see, the path of disinflation has been bumpy. I expect that to continue to be the case. I find it helpful to look at the components of inflation to better understand underlying trends. Looking at figure 7, core goods inflation, the blue line, is running close to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a better alignment between supply and demand after pandemic-related distortions. Nonhousing services inflation, the red dashed line, has cooled largely in line with slower wage growth. Housing services inflation, the purple dotted line, remains somewhat elevated, but I expect more progress in that category as the earlier slowing in growth of rents for new tenants feeds through into growth of average rents.6 With supply and demand conditions having moved into better balance, wage growth slowing to a more sustainable pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored, I see a path for inflation to continue its progress toward our longer-run goal. While the easing of overall inflation in recent years has been encouraging, the fact is that it remains above our 2 percent objective. Monthly inflation readings tend to be volatile, consistent with the bumpy path I described, but the 12-month readings have held in a fairly consistent range somewhat above our target over the second half of last year. Monetary Policy In the current environment, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my projections. As I have already mentioned, there have been notable recent instances where forecasters have been surprised. That said, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and I am attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate. That better balanced position is partly a result of the monetary policy actions over the past few years, which I will review briefly. As you can see in figure 8, the FOMC responded to elevated inflation by raising the policy rate 5-14 percentage points over about 15 months, starting in March 2022, and then holding the rate at that restrictive level for more than a year. This contributed to inflation easing from a 40-year high to near current levels while maintaining a solid labor market. That outcome was historically unusual but greatly welcomed. By September of last year, I had growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market could be maintained in a context of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. The FOMC reduced the federal funds rate by a full percentage point over the course of our final three meetings last year. As a result of those actions, our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive than it was when we began lowering the federal funds rate. Given current economic conditions specifically, inflation that remains modestly above our target and a labor market that is solid and my projections of future economic conditions, I voted last week to maintain our current policy stance. As long as the economy and labor market remain strong, I see it as appropriate for the Committee to be cautious in making further adjustments. Over the medium term, I continue to see a gradual reduction in the level of monetary policy restraint placed on the economy as we move toward a more neutral stance as the most likely outcome. That said, I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance. In considering additional adjustments to the federal funds rate, I will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As is always the case, monetary policy is not on a preset course. To that end, I could envision a range of scenarios for future policy. For example, if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. Alternatively, if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, it may be appropriate to reduce the policy rate more quickly. Our current stance of policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. As I conclude, I want to assure you that I am mindful that monetary policy decisions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. I highly value opportunities to visit places like Lafayette College and Easton to share my views, hear from you, and see how the economy is experienced firsthand in your community. I remain fully committed to supporting maximum employment and bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. Thank you.\",\n          \"January 09, 2025 Reflections on 2024: Monetary Policy, Economic Performance, and Lessons for Banking Regulation Governor Michelle W. Bowman At the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach, California Let me begin by recognizing the devastation caused by the fires in the Los Angeles area. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted and the first responders who are fighting to bring the fires under control. I would like to thank the California Bankers Association for the invitation to speak to you today.1 I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the past year, on both the path of monetary policy and the economy and on how this past experience can inform the bank regulatory agenda as we look ahead to a new year. In light of the policy decisions at the last few Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, I will begin by providing some perspective on my votes and then discuss my current views on the economy and monetary policy. Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meetings At the September meeting last year, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 12 percentage point to 4-34 to 5 percent. Although I was unable to support such a large cut at that time, I did agree with the Committee's assessment that it was appropriate to begin the process of recalibrating policy to reflect the progress in both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market since the middle of 2023. My dissent favored a smaller initial cut to begin the recalibration process and was the first FOMC dissent by a Board member in nearly 20 years. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting that noted that moving the policy rate down too quickly would carry the risk of unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures. In addition, since inflation continues to hover well above our 2 percent goal, there was a real risk that the Committee's large policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. At both our November and December meetings, the Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 14 percentage point, bringing it to 4-14 to 4-12 percent. I supported the December policy action because, in my view, it represented the Committee's final step in the policy recalibration phase. The target range now reflects 100 basis points of cuts since September, and the policy rate is now closer to my estimate of its neutral level, which is higher than before the pandemic. But given the lack of continued progress on lowering inflation and the ongoing strength in economic activity and in the labor market, I could have supported taking no action at the December meeting. Still, I am pleased that the post-meeting statement continued to reference a flexible and data-dependent approach for considering future policy adjustments. It is important that we remain focused on returning inflation to 2 percent. I expect that the coming months should bring clarity on the incoming administration's policies and the carry over of inflationary pressures from 2024, reflecting private spending decisions and an apparent faster spend-out of existing federal government appropriations in recent months. It will be very important to understand how these factors will affect economic activity and inflation going forward. The Economy Towards the End of 2024 and Risks to the Outlook The U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. However, core inflation remains elevated, and I continue to see upside risks to inflation. The rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but this progress appears to have stalled last year with core inflation still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation which excludes food and energy prices moved back up to 2.8 percent in October and November, only slightly below its 3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has stalled since the spring of last year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines. Persistently elevated core inflation continues to reflect pressures on housing services prices, possibly due to an increase in demand for affordable housing amid an inelastic supply. It also appears to be originating from a few other major components in recent months, such as in goods and in services with imputed prices. Gross domestic product increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly increased in the third quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high mortgage rates. The latest data suggest continued strength in consumer spending in the fourth quarter as retail sales and sales of light vehicles continued to rise appreciably. Post-election consumer sentiment appears to be improving, but it remains well below pre-pandemic levels likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy price increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households have experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have limited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services. The most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains rebounded in November, following a temporary drag in October from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike. On balance, job gains averaged about 130,000 over those two months, a pace only slightly below the average gains in the second and third quarters. The unemployment rate rose to a still low 4.2 percent in November, but it has moved sideways since July. While unemployment is notably higher than in 2023, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of full employment, and we will receive the December employment report tomorrow. The labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the historically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 had only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth remains indicative of a tight labor market and above the pace consistent with our inflation goal. The rise in the unemployment rate last year largely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force took longer to find work, while layoffs remained low. Although there has been some cooling in labor demand and the labor force participation rate declined a bit further in November, the household survey may have failed to capture the usual seasonal hiring ahead of the holidays due to the unusually early survey week and the late Thanksgiving holiday. More concerningly, the labor market data have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to accurately account for other influences. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret the monthly data from the payroll and household surveys. It is crucial that U.S. official data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in recent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases. Turning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full employment, but it is possible that we could see a deterioration in labor market conditions. Global supply chains continue to be susceptible to shocks, including labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, namely in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia, which could result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. The potential release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and business sentiment, could also present inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given the long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it is not my baseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall. The Path Forward Looking ahead, we should be cautious in considering changes to the policy rate as we move toward a more neutral setting. Future actions should be based on a careful assessment of ongoing and sustained progress in achieving our goals, and we must be clear in our communication about how further changes are intended to affect economic conditions. We should also refrain from prejudging the incoming administration's future policies. Instead, we should wait for more clarity and then seek to understand the effects on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. I also continue to be concerned that the current stance of policy may not be as restrictive as others may see it. Given the ongoing strength in the economy, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing costs are providing meaningful restraint. With equity prices more than 20 percent higher than a year ago, easier financial conditions may be contributing to the lack of further progress on slowing inflation. In fact, concerns about inflation risks seem to partly explain the recent notable increase in the 10-year Treasury yield back to values last seen in the spring of 2024. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy. Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our next meeting later this month, we will have seen new reports on consumer and producer price inflation. In addition to closely watching the incoming data and broader financial conditions, I will continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. It is also important to clearly explain how we consider progress in meeting our inflation and employment goals in our policy deliberations. Restoring price stability is essential for fostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term. Approach to Bank Regulatory Policy Turning to banking, I will start by sharing my thoughts on bank supervision and regulation. This year will see a transition in leadership at the banking agencies, and I expect that this will translate into a shift in priorities and approach. I am optimistic that by working collaboratively to focus on our statutory mandates, the banking agencies can improve how we fulfill our responsibilities in a fair, efficient, and accountable way. Adopting a more pragmatic approach to policymaking, one that imposes discipline in the exercise of the extensive powers and important responsibilities granted by Congress, would be most effective.2 Public debates about the bank regulatory framework routinely focus on whether regulators are being \\\"hard enough\\\" on banks, or whether the framework is too \\\"lenient.\\\" Framing the debate this way suggests a binary approach that ignores the known tradeoffs in any regulatory action like raising capital requirements or downgrading a bank's management rating for minor issues to show \\\"toughness.\\\" This approach interprets a rational prioritization of regulatory matters as being too bank friendly. While policy views may differ, policy debates should not misinterpret the dynamic of how banks and regulators should operate. In short, bank regulation and supervision need not be an adversarial system, with banks and regulators acting in opposition. Rather, banks and regulators often have the shared goal of a banking system that is safe, sound, and effective, with each serving an important role in furthering these objectives. As we move away from this type of binary thinking, that leaves the question of how regulators can best accomplish their statutory objectives. As a starting point, we must identify the objectives we are trying to achieve. In conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve has the important responsibility of promoting the safe and sound operation of individual banks and the stability of the broader financial system. In many cases, these goals are complementary. When individual banks operate in a safe and sound manner, the banking system generally promotes the stability of the U.S. financial system. Of course, these objectives require a degree of balance if we want the banking system to serve the U.S. economy and facilitate economic growth. When we promote safety and soundness for example by raising capital requirements that has an effect on the aggregate lending capacity of the banking system and the availability of credit, particularly for less qualified borrowers. We must approach the task of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. We have the same responsibility to understand and appreciate the tradeoffs when we exercise our supervisory authority. I am optimistic about the future of banking in the United States and believe that the banking regulators can support the banking system by adopting a more pragmatic approach. While this is a non-exclusive list, I continue to believe the areas that we should focus on should include (1) prioritizing safety and soundness, (2) renewing our commitment to regulatory tailoring, and (3) increasing transparency.3 Prioritization of Safety and Soundness In 2024, bank regulators were still operating under the shadow of the 2023 bank failures, particularly the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The risks facing SVB interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer base of the bank have long been important issues that have been prioritized during examinations. At its root, SVB's failure exposed significant flaws not only in the bank's management but also in the approach to oversight and supervision. As we approach regulatory and supervisory reform from the perspective of pragmatism, we need to take a close look at what went wrong and what could be fixed. Regulatory tools to improve management are imperfect and may be limited in their effectiveness before a bank has failed, but we have great latitude to modify our approach to supervision. One pragmatic change would be to prioritize safety and soundness and deprioritize matters that are not essential to or that are tangential to our statutory obligations. After SVB's failure, we saw a wide range of regulatory proposals. These have included substantial increases in bank capital requirements and pushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms. They have also included finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound firms and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks. Many of these proposals have targeted concerns well beyond remediating issues identified during the 2023 banking stress but have been justified in a generic way at least in part as a \\\"response\\\" to the failure of SVB. In many cases, the nexus between a proposed reform and how that reform would remediate any of the underlying issues that caused the failure of SVB or caused stress in the broader banking system is not clearly articulated. When the agencies pursue reforms, it is critical that the problem is clearly identified and that an explanation is given for how each proposal would address the problem. We should not characterize all reforms as \\\"crisis response\\\" actions, as doing so does not relieve us of the responsibility to analyze and justify the tradeoffs and alternatives of any particular measure. There is substantial room for agreement and consensus. We all want a banking system that can effectively provide credit, including to underserved consumers and businesses. We all want a banking system that is resilient in the face of changing economic conditions. We all want a banking system in which banks are free to experiment and innovate to better serve their customers. And we all want a banking system in which banks are held to high but economically reasonable standards in terms of capital, risk management and compliance. The process of any reform or change to the bank regulatory framework should begin with an identification of the problem, followed by an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency's statutory authorities, and an evaluation of whether targeted changes could result in improvements, remediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements. The resulting framework will better promote safety and soundness in a more durable and consistent way over time, while also continuing to support economic growth. Renewed Commitment to Tailoring Like you, I firmly believe in the virtues of tailoring not only as a statutory responsibility but as a key to forming sensible and effective bank regulatory policy.4 Tailoring can help ensure regulators focus on the most critical risks over time and avoid the over-allocation of resources or imposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve has not only statutory responsibilities established by Congress, but a responsibility to use our resources efficiently and effectively in the execution of our duties. Over the past two years, we have seen proposals that would materially reduce the tailoring of regulatory requirements, particularly as it relates to capital (the so-called Basel III \\\"endgame\\\" reforms) and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with over $100 billion in assets. Both proposals raise significant policy questions as to whether the costs are justified by the benefits questions not sufficiently addressed in the proposals and pose significant risks of unintended consequences. Essentially, this type of approach to capital \\\"flattens\\\" requirements across large banks. And coupled with other potential reforms to liquidity and funding requirements, this approach could lead to substantial industry consolidation as medium-sized banks weigh the benefits and costs to comply with an aggregate set of requirements more suitable for the largest banks. We should be cautious of these types of piecemeal regulatory proposals and instead think more holistically about the aggregate impacts as part of our process. Tailoring also plays an important role in supervision, an area that historically has differentiated expectations for firms based on size, business model, risk profile, and complexity. These criteria provide a reasonable basis to take a different approach based on the unique characteristics of each bank, and as banks shift in size and evolve in business model and risk, it is appropriate to recalibrate expectations. However, I see a growing risk that under the veil of supervision, there has been an erosion of a risk-based approach, and effectively a \\\"push-down\\\" of regulatory requirements designed and calibrated for larger firms to apply to smaller firms. I continue to believe that tailoring should be a central tenet of our regulatory and supervisory approach and framework and believe that we must renew our commitment to this philosophy going forward. I am confident that going forward, regulators will return to regulatory tailoring, particularly for community banks with straightforward business models. Increasing Transparency Regulators should operate in a transparent way and carefully and meticulously follow administrative procedures when making revisions to the regulatory framework. We should take a similar approach to shifts in supervisory focus. Doing so promotes trust and accountability to the public and should be integral to the important work we do promoting the safe and sound operation of the banking system and financial stability. Transparency also promotes innovation in the financial system by enabling banks to understand how to engage in new activities. This is especially important as digital assets and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the financial system. A deliberate, transparent, and fact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives helps us \\\"show our work,\\\" that we are focused on pursuing our policy goals, and are avoiding straying into political concerns outside of statutory purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit picking winners and losers or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination. Transparency promotes fairness, as regulated entities and the public can better understand why and how our actions further our goals. When we identify areas that suffer from a lack of transparency, we should act promptly to address those concerns. Take, for example, the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress testing process. On December 23, the Fed announced that it would soon seek public comment on \\\"significant changes\\\" to the stress testing process designed to improve transparency of the tests and reduce volatility of the resulting stress capital buffers that apply to large financial institutions.5 Given my longstanding support for revisiting the stress testing framework to promote transparency and reduce volatility, I am pleased with this development.6 Transparency can lead to better public engagement and outcomes and should be a central part of the regulatory and supervisory approach, even when not legally mandated, such as in supervision. Supervision involves examiners probing bank operations and assessing a bank's approach to risk and risk management. Much of this information is confidential and commercially sensitive and, therefore, not available to the public or released without risking some degree of harm to the institution. But the confidential nature and approach to supervision tends to result in a wide range of information being categorized as confidential supervisory information (CSI) and subject to restrictions on sharing. This information ends up being shielded from public scrutiny and becomes a barrier to banks engaging in discussion with peers and other regulators to better understand supervisory expectations. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet changes in supervisory expectations often arise in the course of an ongoing examination. As a result, the ability of a financial institution to be proactive to work to meet any new expectations is impossible until they have received supervisory feedback, often in the form of a supervisory finding or matter requiring attention or, in extreme cases, in a formal or informal supervisory action. I am not suggesting that there are always simple solutions to improve transparency, and certainly it is appropriate that much of the information developed in the supervisory process remains shielded as confidential supervisory information. But regulators must also acknowledge the new world in which we operate, one in which administrative law increasingly demands greater transparency and accountability to act as a check on regulatory overreach. Closing Thoughts Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on the economy and bank regulatory matters with you today. In the coming months, I look forward to seeing the impacts of the new administration's policies on the economy and assessing how monetary policy should respond going forward. Today, the U.S. economy begins the new year on a strong footing, with still elevated inflation and a solid labor market. The new year brings an opportunity to reflect on the experience and lessons learned in the past few years and to take a critical look at improving the bank regulatory framework, including both supervision and regulation. And while I have laid out a few broad areas that I think deserve special attention focusing on safety and soundness, renewing our commitment to tailoring, and improving transparency my hope is that the steps we take to improve the regulatory framework in the future focus on pragmatism as a guiding principle.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Immediate Rise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Kugler At Ec10b Principles of Economics Lecture, Department of Economics, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts Governor Adriana D. Kugler presents a lecture about inflation dynamics and the Phillips Curve to students in Harvard University's Ec10b Principles of Economics class on Monday, April 7, 2025. In the lecture she discusses how pandemic-era inflation came in a series of waves: food, core goods, core services and housing. She then talks about the Phillips curve as a model to capture inflation dynamics. Finally, Governor Kugler explores additional augmentations to the Phillips curve model that could help better explain the most recent inflation episode.\",\n          \"February 20, 2025 Risks and Challenges for Bank Regulation and Supervision Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr At Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. Banks play an indispensable role in an economy that works for everyone.1 They enable households to borrow to buy a home, save for the future, and deal with the ups and downs of managing finances. Banks provide the credit for businesses to smooth out income and expenses, supply capital to seize new opportunities and create jobs, and facilitate the flow of payments that are the lifeblood of our economy. And banks borrow from households and businesses as well, such as through federally insured deposits. Because of these vital roles, we need to make sure that banks are resilient and serve as a source of strength to the economy in both good times and when the financial system comes under stress. In our market economy, like any business, banks compete with each other and pursue profits by balancing risk-taking with safety and soundness. But because of the key role banks play in the economy, and the fact that banks do not fully internalize the costs of their own failure, regulation and supervision must ensure that banks do not take on excessive risks that can cause widespread harm to households and businesses. Bank failures are as old as banking, and we've seen repeated waves of bank failures over the centuries. America learned that hard lesson nearly 100 years ago, when bank failures played a central role in the Great Depression. In response, the United States and many other countries around the globe set up a system of deposit insurance and enabled emergency lending in times of stress. To balance the moral hazard of the federal safety net, Congress established a framework of regulation and supervision to make it more likely that banks internalize the costs to society of their risk-taking. But finance is always evolving, and the buildup of new risks led to the banking crisis of the 1980s, and then to the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating consequences. Weaknesses that were revealed in regulation and supervision led to unprecedented and unpopular bailouts, and shuttered American businesses, devastated local communities with foreclosures, and millions of individuals lost their jobs and their livelihoods. Government responded in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and in regulatory reforms by significantly strengthening bank oversight to curb excessive risk-taking. The message from the American people was clear: risk-taking must be balanced with the overarching need to maintain a resilient banking system that can continue to play its crucial role for households and businesses in good times and in bad. Another, perennial lesson from the history of bank regulation and supervision is that the job is never done, and that the constant evolution of finance means risks will also evolve. As Vice Chair for Supervision, I have recognized the need to approach this mission with humility, aware that I don't have all the answers or perfect foresight of where things can go wrong. Both regulators and banks are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify and measure risks. Our financial system is complex, interconnected, and evolving. We cannot fully appreciate how a specific vulnerability can interact with other vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the face of shocks, let alone accurately anticipate shocks in time to avoid them. When I became Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022, the Global Financial Crisis was almost 15 years past, and much had been done to strengthen the resilience of the system to reflect lessons learned. But in March 2023, we experienced the second largest bank failure in history, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. SVB's failure triggered stress throughout the system and required the issuance of a systemic risk exemption and the creation of an emergency bank lending program.2 We have made some progress toward addressing the gaps that led to the failures. But there will be headwinds that we must guard against in the coming years, as well as ongoing vulnerabilities and areas of risk that require continued vigilance. Earlier this year, I announced I would step down as Vice Chair for Supervision but remain a member of the Board of Governors. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of households and businesses. I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor. In this role, I'll continue to participate in monetary policy deliberations and vote on matters before the Board, including those related to supervision and regulation. While it was a tough decision to make, I believe it was the right decision for the institution and, more importantly, for the public, whom we serve. The risk of a dispute over my position would be a distraction from our important mission. I feel strongly as Chair Powell has said publicly many times that the independence of the Federal Reserve is critical to our ability to meet our statutory mandates and serve the American public. Put simply, our mission is too important to let such a dispute distract from doing our job for the American people. Since my term for Vice Chair for Supervision will end later this month, I'd like to use one of my last opportunities as Vice Chair to discuss seven specific risks ahead: (1) maintaining and finishing post-financial crisis reforms; (2) maintaining the credibility of the stress test; (3) maintaining credible, consistent supervision; (4) encouraging responsible innovation; (5) addressing cyber and third-party risk; (6) risks in the nonbank sector; and (7) climate risk. Each will continue to be a risk in either the near- or long-term. Maintaining and Finishing Post-Financial Crisis Reforms There is always push back on financial regulation. I felt that even in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, as I helped to draft the legislative response to that crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act.3 And I felt that over the last few years as we worked to finish the job of post-crisis financial reform and take up evolving threats revealed from the latest bank stress. It is important to get the balance right, but it is also important to stand up for the American people. I urge regulators to finish the job of implementing the final plank of the Global Financial Crisis reforms and not to dismantle the hard-fought resilience that banks have built up in the process. Of course, there are always ways to increase efficiency and reform prior methods without costs to resiliency, and I support those efforts. But as I've spoken about many times, capital is critical to absorb losses and enable banks to continue operations through times of stress, and capital requirements should be aligned with the risks that banks take.4 The Basel III endgame reforms include many improvements to how we measure credit, trading, operational, and derivatives risks in light of our experience in the Global Financial Crisis. All major jurisdictions except the United States have finalized rules that would implement these standards for their internationally active banks. The Federal Reserve played a central role in developing these standards in the many years before my arrival as Vice Chair. The Board sought comment on a proposal in July 2023 to implement the Basel III reforms, and we received a wide range of comments on the proposal.5 On the basis of those comments, I took steps last fall to outline broad and material changes that would better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received and would result in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of banks.6 These reforms had broad consensus on the Board and the support of the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. When the U.S. provides leadership in international forums like Basel and then follows through, we set a powerful example and establish a standard that other jurisdictions also uphold. Implementing international standards enables U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field across the globe and makes the system safer. When we don't follow through on our commitments, for whatever reason, concerns about a level playing field rise in other jurisdictions, in an international \\\"race to the bottom\\\" on standards. This harms us all and makes U.S. banks less competitive. And unless the U.S. implements these standards, other jurisdictions will force U.S. banks operating abroad to meet their standards instead. Let me turn to unfinished business from the March 2023 banking stress. In that event, we learned that bank runs and bank failures can happen fast, much faster than before. Before SVB, the largest bank to fail did so over a period of several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours.7 Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked with banks to improve their ability to borrow from the discount window, and the financial system's collective readiness has improved significantly compared to pre-SVB, including with a substantial increase of $1 trillion in collateral pledged across the system.8 The Federal Reserve has also worked to improve the functioning of the discount window, through a concerted effort to gather public input and identify areas for modernization. These efforts have improved the ability of banks to weather stress, both individually and collectively, which enhances financial stability. However, there is still more work to do. For instance, banks, even the largest banks, are not currently required to establish a minimum level of readiness at the window, and, as a result, there are outlier firms that are not prepared for stress. This needs to change. Without a requirement there is also a significant risk of backtracking on the substantial progress in readiness we have made since March 2023. Another important lesson from SVB is a classic one: balance sheet vulnerabilities among a group of institutions can be a source of contagion for the financial system and thus a key stability risk. While we did much to improve the resilience of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the past decade, March 2023 showed that significant systemic risks can develop and spread from stress anywhere in the system, including in large and regional banks that are not G-SIBs.9 The resilience of these firms has improved as they have recognized their vulnerabilities, and we have worked through supervisory channels to encourage risk-management practices that put them on a firmer footing. But we also need to put in place more durable solutions to address risks. For one, the level of capital held by large banks needs to align with the underlying risks on their balance sheets. One important step would be to finalize the requirement that all large firms reflect unrealized losses on available for sale securities in their capital, which is a reform with broad agreement. This will help them manage interest rate risk before it gets to extreme levels, a significant problem revealed in the banking stress of two years ago. Another lesson from the spring of 2023 is that large and regional banks as well as G-SIBs should ensure that they can actually monetize the securities on which they rely for their liquidity. Why does this matter? Banks need to be able to turn a portion of their assets into cash with a speed sufficient to meet outflows when uninsured depositors or other short-term creditors demand it. Regulation needs to reflect realistic assumptions about monetization. We should also consider updating some assumptions about deposit outflows in our liquidity requirements so that they better align with observed stress behavior. During the stress in 2023, we saw uninsured deposits from high-net worth individuals and certain entities, such as venture capital firms, behave more like highly sophisticated financial counterparties than nonfinancial companies or ordinary retail depositors, which is how they are generally treated in regulations.10 This mis-measured risk of deposit outflows means banks may not have sufficient liquidity to manage a stress period. In a related vein, banks have stepped up their use of reciprocal deposit arrangements arrangements where deposits are spread across many banks within a network as a way to manage the risk of deposit amounts over $250,000.11 While this arrangement spreads risk across the banking system, it is a strategy that has not been tested in a large-scale stress event. It is only logical to wonder how the attenuation of relationships between customers and banks under reciprocal arrangements will affect the behavior of depositors worried about a bank run. We also need to be attentive to operational risks in these arrangements, as well as the risk-management capacity of these companies to manage these relationships under stress. A final lesson from the bank stress two years ago is that we need to do more to ensure that all banks that come under stress can be resolved in an orderly fashion. One way to do this would be to require all large banks including those that are not G-SIBS to issue certain amounts of long-term debt. This would have helped reassure depositors worried about the stability of bank funding and aided in the eventual resolution of at least some of the banks that came under stress in 2023. The banking agencies have proposed a rule on long-term debt requirements, we have received many helpful comments that led us to adjust it in draft form, and I support moving forward to finalize it with those adjustments.12 As I mentioned, revised Basel III standards, revised long-term debt requirements, and to-be-proposed liquidity standards would help to address gaps in our current framework, and I continue to believe that they should move forward. Moreover, banks and supervisors should also stay vigilant to known risks in the current environment. For instance, risks remain in the commercial real estate market, particularly within the office segment, as borrowers may find it difficult to refinance maturing loans. And interest rate risk, especially for those with high levels of uninsured deposits, remains a key area of focus. Maintain the Credibility of the Stress Test We face a challenging environment with the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. The stress tests helped the financial sector emerge from the Global Financial Crisis and rebuild its credibility. The annual stress tests are still important to the financial sector's credibility today. The stress tests help banks, market participants, and supervisors understand the banks' vulnerabilities to shocks and to guard against those shocks by holding sufficient capital. In December, the Board announced that, due to the evolving legal landscape, we would be undertaking significant changes to the stress tests to reduce capital volatility and improve transparency.13 While I recognize that we need to increase transparency to reflect changes in the legal environment in which we operate, there are good reasons why I and many of my colleagues and predecessors have been averse to such full disclosures since the inception of the stress test fifteen years ago. There are several risks that we will need to guard against. First, we need to guard against the risk that the process results in reduced capital requirements. As they did during the Basel III process, banks are likely to argue against various aspects of the Fed's models that result in higher capital requirements, and not to highlight the areas in which the models underestimate risks. We should take those comments on the Fed's models seriously and adjust the models as appropriate, but we should be careful not to overcorrect and lower bank capital requirements in ways that underestimate aggregate risk. The Administrative Procedure Act should be a vehicle for transparency and public input into agency action, not used to weaken regulatory requirements that preserve the safety and stability of our financial system. Second, we need to guard against the risk that banks lower their capital requirements because of increased transparency. Increased disclosure of details about the Fed's stress models could enable banks to optimize stress test results by adjusting their balance sheet based on their knowledge of where the models underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements without materially reducing risks. Gaming the test in this way would be a bad outcome for risk management and our economy. Third, banks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. We should be aware of the risk that full transparency into the models and scenarios used by regulators could discourage banks from investing in their own risk management if the test becomes too predictable. Full transparency may also encourage concentration across the system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. And banks are likely to reduce their management buffers over required levels, which will bring greater risks of breaching the minimums and regulatory buffers when a significant risk event eventually happens. The fourth risk, and perhaps the greatest one, is that over time, given the difficulty of navigating the notice and comment rulemaking process on an ongoing basis to update the models we use, the dynamism and accuracy of the stress test will fade.14 And as the events of two years ago show, it is hard to predict where risks will emerge in the financial system; an inherent challenge of preserving the relevancy of stress testing is coming up with a set of adverse scenarios that are novel enough, and dynamic enough, to reflect the risks that banks may face from unanticipated developments. I believe that the Fed should commit to investing in a credible, effective process to maintain the dynamism of the binding stress test by regularly updating its models and scenario variables to reflect changes in the environment and changes to bank behavior. This will require resources and a strong commitment up front and over time, but it will be necessary to maintain a credible stress test. One effort we've already undertaken should help: to maintain the dynamism of the stress test, we launched exploratory stress scenarios to consider a wider range of possible conditions.15 The Fed used this approach during the pandemic, and we've now made it a regular part of our annual stress test exercise.16 The exploratory scenarios are not used to set binding capital requirements and are only reported on an aggregate level, but they help the Fed better understand risks posed to individual banks and to the banking system as a whole that are not captured in binding scenarios. I hope and trust that the Fed will continue this important analytical work. As an additional backstop to help ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand losses, the Fed should preserve its discretion to set individually binding capital requirements on firms based on supervisory judgment under the International Lending Supervision Act. Jurisdictions around the world undertake a similar process under a so-called Basel \\\"Pillar 2\\\" approach, and the United States would benefit from using such a framework as well. That is all the more important given the changes the Fed is undertaking for the binding stress tests. Maintaining Credible, Consistent Supervision Another area warranting continued vigilance is supervision. There will undoubtedly be calls to revamp supervision to reduce burden. And I am all for making sure supervision is the most effective and efficient it can be. Supervisors need to focus on the most urgent and important risks, and not burden firms with unnecessary or distracting matters. But we need to be careful to preserve and enhance the ability of supervisors to act with speed, force, and agility as appropriate to the risk. Supervisors have emphasized proactive supervisory engagement, which helps banks address issues before they grow so large as to threaten the bank or broader financial stability. Earlier intervention means that firms are likely to have more options to fix their problems, with little impact on bank profitability.17 We should continue work to improve the effectiveness of our supervision and use data-driven analysis to improve our scoping and prioritization of supervisory issues. I support this work to the extent that it makes our supervision more effective and focused on the right issues. But the Board should resist initiatives that impede effective supervision by discouraging examiners to flag issues early, or initiatives that increase unnecessary process around issuing findings in a manner that impedes the speed and agility of supervision when it is needed. More generally, supervision is another area in which \\\"efficiency and competitiveness\\\" should not be used as an excuse for lax oversight that significantly impairs the safety and soundness of individual institutions and undermines broader financial stability. We should take caution from our experience with SVB. While some have claimed that the examiners at SVB did not focus on the right issues, it's important to highlight that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the Fed allocated an insufficient number of examiner resources to SVB while in the RBO portfolio, and that the examiners assigned to SVB as it was growing did not have sufficient expertise in supervising large, complex institutions.18 Once it was in the large bank portfolio, examiners highlighted the risk from interest rate risk and uninsured depositors, but did not act with sufficient force to get the bank to change course in a timely way. We've made important changes since then, but we need to be sure we get the staff resources in place, and provide support to examiners on the front line, so that they can act with the speed, force, and agility warranted by the facts. Encouraging Responsible Innovation Another set of risks involve those related to the role of innovative technology in the financial sector. Innovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial institutions, and the economy at large. For instance, blockchain technology underlying crypto-assets has the potential to make financial services better, cheaper, and faster. Responsible use of this technology could make banking more efficient and accessible to more consumers. With any new technology, there are new risks. To achieve the benefits in a durable manner over time, we must ensure that the associated risks are managed appropriately. With crypto-assets, investors do not currently have the structural protections they have relied on for many decades in other financial markets. It is important that those guardrails are put in place to avoid issues such as the misuse of client funds, misrepresentations, obfuscation about availability of deposit insurance, and fraud. We should also recognize that some of the attractive attributes of crypto-assets the pseudonymous actors that are parties to transactions, the ease and speed of transfer, and the general irrevocability of transactions also make crypto-assets attractive for use in money laundering and terrorist financing. It is encouraging to see innovators develop tools and processes to better manage these risks, while harnessing the benefits of the technology. But regulation and supervision also have an essential role to play. Responsible innovation is in everyone's interest. In the past few years, we stood up the Novel Activities Supervision Program, which dedicates resources to understanding how technology is transforming banking and supports banks' ability to innovate while ensuring that banks clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities.19 I hope and trust that approach will continue. Addressing Cyber and Third-Party Risk Cyber risk from both foreign powers and non-state actors has become a major concern for banks, and regulators will need to ensure that these risks are being properly managed. The operational disruption propagated through a third-party security company last summer was a wake-up call for banks and regulators about vulnerabilities in a system where security is outsourced. Disruption of one of these critical systems may compromise a bank's ability to execute important functions and adversely affect individual firm safety and soundness as well as the broader financial system. Given the significant concentration in the IT industry, we should expect operational failures at single IT entities to have potentially far-reaching effects, no matter their original cause. And advances in artificial intelligence are likely to give bad actors new tools for fraud and infiltration, while also providing banks with new tools to combat these attacks. Both banks and the Federal Reserve need to continue to invest in cyber resiliency. Risks in the Nonbank Sector Let me speak next to the perennial concerns of intermediation by financial firms outside the bank regulatory perimeter. An increasingly varied and evolving collection of nonbank clients, including hedge funds, private credit, and insurance companies, is playing a significant role in the global economy and presenting new risks. Beginning with hedge funds, bank exposures to hedge funds have risen over the past several years, and concurrently, hedge fund leverage remains near historic highs.20 Archegos's failure revealed the risks presented by hedge funds and the degree of interconnectedness between banks and hedge funds. And the exploratory analysis as part of last year's stress test showed that banks have material exposures to hedge funds under certain market conditions, and that the hedge fund counterparty exposures can vary significant based on the specific set of shocks.21 One area that has grown substantially is the Treasury cash-futures basis trade.22 The basis trade helps provide liquidity and price discovery in normal times, as hedge funds trade with asset managers and other financial institutions to align returns to holding Treasury securities and related futures. But the trade involves high levels of leverage, which can contribute to a rapid unwinding in positions and exacerbate market stress, as we saw in the spring of 2020. In principle, margining practices and participants' risk-management activities should limit these risks, but individual firms do not account for the spillovers their actions can have on market functioning. These externalities suggest a role for regulation, and the central clearing mandate for Treasury market trading is an important step in supporting the resilience of this market. At the same time, we need to continue to consider how we can support the collection of minimum margin across trading venues and in bilateral trades to avoid loopholes and risks, and continue to monitor banks' credit risk management practices with these hedge fund counterparties. Another area that has experienced rapid growth in recent years is private credit, which is now comparable in size to the high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market.23 Traditional private credit arrangements rely on limited leverage and generally have long-term funding, making them less vulnerable to the deleveraging spiral associated with high leverage and short-term funding. Nonetheless, risks may be growing. The connections between private credit and banks have been expanding, and private credit remains opaque, with limited information relative to asset classes of similar size.24 Moreover, the rapid growth and opacity of the sector raise the risk that recent private credit arrangements may be assuming new risks. Retail investors can now gain exposure to the asset class through mutual or exchange traded funds, which could present the age-old consumer and financial stability risks we see when opaque, illiquid assets are converted to liquid ones.25 We also need to monitor risks in the insurance industry. Households planning for retirement often rely on life insurance companies to provide them a steady stream of income. In principle, life insurance companies are the ultimate patient investor and thus the natural vehicle to finance long-maturity and risky projects. Indeed, while venture capital funding gets a lot of the attention, mobilized retirement savings through life insurance companies have supported long-term investments in capital-intensive projects. However, life insurance companies, just like other financial institutions, can overpromise and be tempted to take on greater risk than their liability holders or regulators appreciate. Given the complexity of some investment vehicles, the institutions themselves may not fully appreciate all of the risks. The life insurance sector has been changing. Even as the life insurance industry has been increasing its holdings of assets originated by private equity firms, private equity firms have been acquiring life insurers directly. Moreover, private-equity-affiliated insurers rely more heavily on nontraditional liabilities, which may prove flighty in a stress event. This is something to watch carefully. In the next business cycle downturn, it's possible that unexpected losses at insurance companies could lead to a sharp pullback and deeper credit crunch. Climate Risk Finally, regulators will need to continue to confront the financial risks from climate change. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to recognize emerging risks to the safety and soundness of banks, to the ability of households and businesses to access financial services, and to financial stability. Costly natural disasters could present just such risks. The recent wildfires in California should be a wake-up call that we need to focus on how insurance markets will need to adjust to more frequent and severe weather events. The loss of life and hardship borne by many households is tragic, and the economic losses associated with the wildfires, while uncertain, are likely to be among the largest losses from a natural disaster on record. The wildfires should remind us of the problems in property and casualty insurance markets just as the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Helene reminded us of significant gaps in flood insurance coverage. Often the structure and regulation of insurance markets prevents risk from being appropriately priced, limiting the ability of market signals to influence development and adaptation in high-risk areas and contributing to the buildup of risks. And there is a broader question of the extent to which private capital will be sufficient to cover increasing natural disaster risk. The Federal Reserve has an important but narrow role to play with respect to climate change, and that is to focus on risks from climate change to bank safety and soundness and financial stability. The pilot climate scenario analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve was an important step forward in assessing the capacity of the largest banks, as well as in building our own capacity, to perform the kind of analysis that is increasingly crucial as risks arising from more severe weather events become a driver of financial risk for specific firms and the broader economy.26 Guidance for the largest banks also plays an important role in reminding banks of basic principles in prudent risk management as it applies to these types of climate-related risks. Conclusion In conclusion, the United States has the benefit of a strong, vigorous economy, the deepest and most liquid markets in the world, and a critical place in the world economy through the role of the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve has an essential role in maintaining the strength and resilience of the U.S. economy, including through its vigilance about the risks I discussed today. A strong and resilient banking system benefits the American people. We need to be humble about our ability to predict shocks to the financial system, and how they will propagate through vulnerabilities in the system. That is why it is so important to have strong regulation and supervision as shock absorbers to protect households and businesses from risks emanating from the financial system. In closing, I want to speak directly to the staff of the Federal Reserve and express my deep gratitude. Your rigorous analysis and deep expertise are fundamental to our ability to promote a strong and stable financial system that serves the American people. Thank you for your outstanding service.\",\n          \"March 21, 2025 Statement by Governor Christopher J. Waller Governor Christopher J. Waller At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I supported no change in the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings. Reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is an important part of normalizing monetary policy implementation and reducing unneeded reserves in the banking system. Slowing further or stopping redemptions of securities holdings will be appropriate as we get closer to an ample level of reserves. But in my view we are not there yet because reserve balances stand at over $3 trillion and this level is abundant. There is no evidence from money market indicators or my outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves. The Committee slowed the pace of redemptions in June 2024 to help ensure a smooth transition to the appropriate level of securities holdings needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. I believe that pace continues to be the right one. If unanticipated disturbances to reserve demand emerge on the path to balance sheet normalization, the Federal Reserve System has a variety of tools to address such a development. Rather than changing our current pace of balance sheet reduction, the Federal Reserve should rely on those tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge. Such a plan could be implemented swiftly in the event more reserves need to be injected into the banking system. Even with the decision to slow the pace of runoff at this meeting, a plan is still required should a disturbance occur in the future. While this is a procedural matter, good process leads to good outcomes, and good contingency planning helps avoid disruptions to markets and to the FOMC's efforts to achieve our economic objectives.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Immediate Rise\",\n          \"Immediate Cut\",\n          \"Stable\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
