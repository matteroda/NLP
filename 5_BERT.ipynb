As I look back over these five-plus years, I will consider how a range of\\nuncertainties and risks regarding the macroeconomy and its measurement have affected\\nmonetary policy decisions and communications. I will also highlight some considerations\\nregarding financial stability risks and monetary policy. I will conclude with my own views on\\nthe near-term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my\\noutlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy.\\nSetting Monetary Policy amid a Wide Range of Uncertainties and Risks\\nAn omni-present challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for\\nuncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when\\nsetting monetary policy. Macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary\\npolicy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential\\noutput, or the neutral real interest rate. These unobservable concepts can be estimated but only\\n- 2 -\\nwith a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the estimates may vary over time-for example,\\nbecause of structural changes in the economy. Macroeconomic models are also subject to\\nuncertainty, since they must make simplifying assumptions regarding the complex set of\\nrelationships and interactions among households, businesses, governments, and the financial\\nsystem that also evolve and change. Moreover, the data that are used to estimate model\\nparameters and to formulate the economic outlook are inherently uncertain and are often revised\\nas the statistical agencies refine their estimates or gather more information.\\nIn addition to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic models and measurement, there\\nare a number of risks that, if realized, could shock the economy and financial system, making it\\nmore difficult for policymakers to confidently assess the economy and the economic outlook.\\nDespite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward-looking approach, since its\\nactions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.2\\nThe post-financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound\\nWhen I joined the FOMC in late 2018, despite nearly a decade of accommodative\\nmonetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary\\nthe Committee's\\nconcerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below\\n2 percent inflation target. There was a recognition that the \\\"natural rate of unemployment\\\" may\\nhave been lower than many on the FOMC had estimated, and that inflation may have become\\n- 3 -\\nless responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate.3 This recognition meant that preemptive\\nincreases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone\\nmay not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the\\nCommittee's 2 percent target.\\nA central topic of FOMC meeting discussions throughout 2019 was how monetary policy\\nstrategies and tools could best achieve the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and\\nmaximum employment when structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept\\nunder the Committee's\\ninflation persistently inflation target. There was also a concern that the\\nfederal funds rate, the FOMC's key policy rate, was too close to the \\\"zero lower bound.\\\" And\\nlimit the Committee's ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock\\nthat this proximity could\\nby using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate.\\nMore broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of\\nstructurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes and\\nhigher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor\\ndemand for safe assets like Treasury securities.\\nAt the time, the FOMC assessed that downward risks to both employment and inflation\\nwere likely to remain prominent due to the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound.\\nIn August 2020, the FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\\nMonetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.4 A notable change relative to the initial\\n- 4 -\\nstatement adopted in 2012 was a change in the language addressing how the FOMC would\\nThe new statement noted that the Committee would seek \\\"to mitigate\\nconduct monetary policy.\\n[emphasis added]\\\"-rather than \\\"deviations\\\"-\\\"of employment from the Committee's\\nshortfalls\\nassessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.\\\"5 By\\nthe word \\\"deviations\\\" \\\"shortfalls\\\" when describing\\nreplacing with employment and the\\nCommittee's\\nreaction to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level, the\\nCommittee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based only on the\\nperception of labor market tightness.\\nAnother notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to\\nas flexible average inflation targeting\\\" or \\\"temporary price level targeting.\\\"6\\n\\\"asymmetric\\nstatement noted that\\nSpecifically, the new \\\"in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations\\nat [its 2 percent goal], the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over\\ntime, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently\\nMonetary Policy,\\\" a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\\n(via webcast), August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm; and Richard\\nH.

Although the revised statement reaffirmed the commitment to the\\nCommittee's inflation target,\\nit did not describe how the Committee would respond if inflation\\nwere to run persistently above its 2 percent goal.8\\nGiven the timing of its implementation, the revised strategy guided how the FOMC\\nresponded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years-the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. This shock-combined with the policy responses of governments and\\ncentral banks around the world-disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the\\neconomy over the previous several decades and the post-2008 financial crisis approach to\\nmonetary policy. These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward,\\nbut let's first put the COVID-19 event and response into better context.\\nThe COVID-19 shock and monetary policy response\\nof the FOMC's monetary policy framework review,\\nToward the latter part in March\\n2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and\\nfinancial system. Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing, combined with other\\npandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic\\nactivity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced\\n- 6 -\\nsignificant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded\\nforcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid\\n(and I'll have more to say on\\nshutdown of the U.S. economy this topic later).\\nAs a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal\\nfunds rate back to 0 to 1/4 percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency\\nmortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth\\nfunctioning of securities markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households. Later, the\\npurchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and\\nlabor markets.9\\nFollowing the return to the zero lower bound, in addition to conducting asset purchases,\\nthe FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep\\nboth short- and longer-term interest rates low. In its March 15, 2020, statement, the FOMC\\nnoted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent\\n\\\"until it [was] confident that the economy [had] weathered recent events and [was] on track to\\nachieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\\\"10 Following the release of the\\nrevised framework in August 2020, the FOMC revised the forward guidance in its September\\npost-meeting statement to be more explicitly outcome-based to state that the target range would\\nremain at 0 to 1/4 percent\\n\\\"until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\\n9\\nThe Federal Reserve implemented 13 emergency lending and liquidity facilities under its emergency lending\\nauthorities and undertook supervisory and regulatory actions to support the flow of credit to households, businesses,\\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), \\\"Coronavirus Disease 2019\\nand local governments.\\n(COVID-19): Funding, Credit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities,\\\" webpage,\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/fundingcredit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023),\\n\\\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19,\\\"\\nwebpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm.\\n10\\nThe March 15, 2020, FOMC statement is available on the Board's website at\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quoted text in paragraph 2).\\n- 7 -\\nCommittee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on\\ntrack to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\\\"11 In its December 2020 post-meeting\\nstatement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting that it\\nexpected that the current pace of asset purchases would continue until \\\"substantial further\\nprogress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability\\ngoals.\\\"12\\nThis explicit outcome-based forward guidance, like the revised monetary policy\\nframework, was very focused on supporting the economy following the COVID-19 shock amid\\nthe risks of persistently low inflation and disinflationary forces with structurally low interest\\nrates. The guidance was also quite restrictive in the criteria for slowing the pace of asset\\npurchases, especially since the FOMC would stop asset purchases before it would raise the\\nfederal funds rate.13\\nOne could argue the December forward guidance made it much more difficult for the\\nFOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in\\nresponse to pandemic-related changes in the economy. Other uncertainties such as the accuracy\\nof real-time economic measurements also presented challenges, as did significant supply-side\\ndisruptions and the uncertainty about the timing of progress toward their resolution, which I will\\ndiscuss next.\\n- 8 -\\nThe post-pandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in\\nmonetary policy\\nIn the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented\\nsupport programs for labor markets and households and businesses.14 These generous policies,\\ncombined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and state and\\nlocal government balance sheets. In particular, they led to what has come to be known as\\n\\\"excess\\nsavings\\\"-above-normal household savings from extraordinary levels of fiscal support\\nand a limited ability to freely spend it due to economic lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and\\nother pandemic- and recession-related factors.\\nIn 2021, novel medical treatments, reduced social distancing, and innovative business\\napproaches in adapting to the restrictive pandemic environment led to a sharp economic rebound.\\nStrong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply\\n(due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID-19), and\\na mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The\\nunusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic-driven shift to consumer goods\\nspending, supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component shortages led to crippling\\nbottlenecks for a number of industries. These supply and demand imbalances, likely amplified\\nby fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over a period of just a few months.\\nBy the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad-\\nbased. Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of\\ntightness, given the decrease in labor force participation and mixed data signals at the time,\\n- 9 -\\nwhich all were later revised. Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most\\nimportant was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply-side issues eventually\\neased.\\nThe September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median\\nFOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the\\nend of 2021, largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021. But for year-end\\n15\\n2022, the median expectation was for PCE inflation to decline to 2.2 percent. Private-sector\\nforecasters expected higher inflation of 5.1 percent at year-end 2021 but also projected a slowing\\nto just over 2 percent by the end of 2022.16 With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that\\nmost forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time,\\nwith 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022. This example underscores the challenge\\nwe faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would\\npersist.\\nIn the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was\\ntoo accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee\\nneeded to move toward a tighter policy stance. It seems likely to me that the experience of the\\nyears leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to\\nforesee how quickly that situation could change. Of course, the inflation and labor data did not\\naccurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently\\nthe FOMC's forward guidance\\nsubstantially revised.17 Together, these factors, combined with\\ndiscussed earlier, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in\\n2021.\\nThe shift in the Committee's forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022\\nwas effective in moving longer-dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial conditions,\\neven before the FOMC raised the federal funds rate.18 At our November 2021 meeting, we\\nannounced that we would begin to slow the pace of purchases later that month. At the December\\n2021 meeting, we doubled the pace of tapering, which accelerated the end of purchases to the\\nfollowing March. At the March 2022 FOMC meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the\\nfederal funds rate by 25 basis points. And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the\\nsize of the Federal Reserve's securities\\nholdings-which then stood at around $8.5 trillion-\\nstarting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet\\nreduction.19 The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate\\nover the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became\\nclear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had expected. By July\\n2023, the FOMC had increased the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 percentage points, and into\\nrestrictive territory, where it has remained. And we have continued to reduce the size of our\\nsecurities holdings.\\n17\\nFor example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth than\\ndid consensus forecasts, and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased. Similarly, total PCE\\ninflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised higher than initially reported.

An important question I will be thinking about going forward is\\nhow to make monetary policy decisions and communications more robust to these types of risks.\\nSeparate tools for monetary policy and financial stability\\nWe know that monetary policy transmission is most effective during periods of stable\\nfinancial conditions, and that financial stability risks, if realized, can affect the economic\\noutlook. While monetary policy and financial stability are connected, financial stability\\nvulnerabilities and risks are most appropriately addressed using macro- and micro-prudential\\nregulation and bank supervision. During periods of extreme financial stress, well-calibrated\\nlending and liquidity programs can be used to address such conditions. Of course, where risks\\nimpact the outlook for economic activity, employment, and inflation, a monetary policy response\\nmay also be required.\\nThe Federal Reserve's use\\nof liquidity and lending programs during the early stages of\\nthe pandemic demonstrated the effectiveness of emergency lending tools as backstops to support\\nmarket functioning and the flow of credit in times of stress.20 Lending programs are most\\neffective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When\\nappropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective\\nbut limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial\\ntransmission of monetary policy\\nmarkets in the longer term. This experience also highlights the importance of clearly\\ndistinguishing monetary policy actions from temporary central bank asset purchase programs\\nused to promote core financial market functioning, like those created to support Treasury\\nmarkets in the spring of 2020.21\\nMore recently, the bank failures last spring highlight that responsive, efficient, and\\neffective bank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities. The\\nfailures revealed that shortcomings in bank supervision can heighten financial stability risks.\\nshould be to address a bank's critical shortcomings in a timely\\nThe primary focus of supervision\\nway.22 To effectively support financial stability, bank supervision cannot simply rely on\\npinpointing compliance issues, failed processes, or rule violations. It must go further to examine\\na bank's risk\\nexposures, including anticipating how the evolving economic environment may\\ninfluence a bank's financial condition and its assessment of\\nrisks. If the supervisory process fails\\nto identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies,\\nlike excess interest rate risk and disproportionately large levels of uninsured deposits, this raises\\nthe potential for safety and soundness concerns.\\nLast year's bank stress the Fed's\\nalso revealed that bank liquidity and payments tools-\\nthe Fed's\\nincluding discount window operations and FedWire\\u00ae-should be available for\\nextended operating hours and prepared to provide support during times of stress. We should also\\nconsider what further steps may be needed to ensure that banks have access to liquidity support.\\nIn addition, we should encourage, but not mandate, the exercise of contingency funding plans\\nand testing capabilities, requiring bank management to ensure adequate plans are in place.23 But\\nthere is a fine line between bank supervision and interfering in the decisions of bank\\nmanagement. Some measure of risk is inherent and necessary in the business of banking.\\nWhile some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote\\nfinancial stability, we should be cautious that these changes do not impair the long-term viability\\nof banks, especially mid-sized and smaller banks.24 In my view, regulatory reform can pose\\nsignificant financial stability risks, particularly if those regulatory changes fail to take sufficient\\naccount of the incentive effects and potential consequences, like pushing activity into the more\\nopaque nonbank financial sector.25 Poorly calibrated regulatory actions can also negatively\\naffect economic activity and reduce the availability of credit by limiting the offering of other\\nfinancial products or services. These concerns are most acute when the reforms may be\\ninefficient or poorly targeted. As an example, policymakers should carefully consider whether\\nthe significant capital increases included in the U.S. Basel III proposal meet this standard of\\nbeing efficient and appropriately targeted.26\\nWhat's Next for the Economy and Monetary Policy?\\nLooking ahead, the FOMC will continue to face a number of risks and uncertainties as it\\nseeks to return inflation to its 2 percent goal.

Given the importance of transparency, it is also necessary that our\\ncommunications explain not only how the economic outlook affects our monetary policy\\noften referred to as the FOMC's \\\"reaction function,\\\"\\ndecisions, but also how the risks and\\nuncertainties surrounding the economic outlook matter for those decisions.\\nWith that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with my own views on the near-term\\neconomic outlook, including some prominent risks and uncertainties, and the implications for\\nmonetary policy.\\nAt our most recent FOMC meeting, I supported keeping the target range for the federal\\nfunds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continuing to reduce our securities holdings. At its\\ncurrent setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately\\ncalibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. We have seen significant progress on lowering\\ninflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong.\\nConsumer services spending has shown continued strength through February, and payroll\\nemployment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter.\\nHowever, most employment gains over the past year have been in part-time employment,\\nand some of the recent strength in job gains may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased\\nimmigration. The 12-month readings of total and core PCE inflation through February printed at\\n2.5 and 2.8 percent, respectively, much lower than a year ago. However, with the annualized\\n3-month PCE inflation readings moving well-above the 12-month measures in February, I expect\\nfurther progress in bringing inflation down to 2 percent will be slower this year.\\nStill, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the\\npolicy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong but with\\nlabor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the number of job openings relative to\\nunemployed workers declines. And should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation\\nis moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to\\ngradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly\\nrestrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy\\nrate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.\\nFirst, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements,\\nincluding easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in\\npart to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side\\nimprovements will continue to lower inflation. For example, the rebound in labor productivity\\nlast year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemic-related labor market\\ndynamics, such as a slowing in the high levels of employee turnover during that time. Therefore,\\nif wage gains remain elevated going forward, these effects may no longer contribute to lower\\nprice inflation in the future.\\nGeopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk of\\nspillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and\\nsupply chains remain exposed to these influences.\\nAnother upside inflation risk I see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spend-out\\nrate from existing and new appropriations. Although some of the recent policies may increase\\nproductive capacity in the medium term, they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting\\naggregate demand.\\nI also see upside risks to housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of\\navailable and affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to certain regions could result in\\nupward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. There is\\nalso a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could\\nlead to persistently higher core services inflation. Inflation readings over the past two months\\nsuggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services.\\nFinally, there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain\\nat a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation\\nand support full employment. In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy,\\nlike higher investment demand relative to available savings, it is quite possible that the level of\\nthe federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the\\npandemic. If that is the case, fewer rate cuts will eventually be appropriate to return our\\nmonetary policy stance to a neutral level. In the most recent SEP, some FOMC participants\\nindicated that they now see fewer rate cuts over 2024 and over the next two years than in\\nDecember. Some also included a higher longer-run level of the federal funds rate than in the\\npast.28\\nWhile it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we\\nmay need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.\\nGiven the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the\\ndata closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my\\napproach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too\\nsoon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate\\nincreases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.\\nClosing Thoughts\\nTo conclude, the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of\\nsetting forward-looking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and\\nuncertainties. Taking into account this experience and the lessons I have learned over my tenure\\non the FOMC, an important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy\\nstrategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes\\nin the macroeconomy. We will continue to learn about the post-pandemic economy, and, if\\nhistory is any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably\\noccur. While the future is full of risks and uncertainties, the FOMC's mandate of fostering price\\nstability and maximum employment remains very clear. Restoring price stability is essential for\\nachieving maximum employment over the longer run.\\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to our\\nconversation.\",\n          \"Luis de Guindos: Interview with Cadena COPE\\nInterview with Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, and Cadena\\nCOPE, conducted by Mr Carlos Herrera on 30 March 2020.\\n* * *\\nAre you teleworking? Are you in lockdown?\\nYes, we're in lockdown and have been teleworking for almost a month now.\\nI'd like to go back in time. You were in a very difficult place at an extremely difficult time,\\ni.e. at the helm of the Spanish economy when the crisis that was triggered between 2007\\nand 2008 reached its peak and Mario Draghi uttered the magic words \\\"...whatever it\\ntakes...\\\", which significantly calmed the markets. Can today's crisis, which is different in\\nnature but devastating nonetheless, also be solved by either you or your President\\nsaying \\\"we will do whatever is necessary\\\", and that will solve everything?\\nWe are already doing whatever is necessary. We have given banks as much liquidity as they\\nneed and the ECB is going to buy more than a trillion euros' worth of euro area bonds. Spain will\\nbenefit to the tune of around \\u20ac120 billion. This is the Spanish economy's main line of defence\\nfrom a financial perspective at the moment.\\nIs this how much Spanish banks, with the government's approval, will be able to grant in\\nterms of loans to whoever asks for them?\\nNo, these are direct purchases made by the European Central Bank.\\nPurchases of debt, of bonds?\\nExactly.\\nDoes this mean money for the government?\\nYes, ultimately. The purchases are made on the secondary market, but will also have an impact\\non the primary market. The ECB is taking steps to help avoid certain situations; do you\\nremember what happened with the spread?\\nYes, it reached 650 points in Spain.\\nThe aim is to ensure spreads don't widen dramatically and to keep the borrowing costs of\\ngovernments under control to avoid an increase in financial stress at this extremely challenging\\ntime.\\nAre you now sure we will be in recession at the end of this quarter?\\nYes. All of the scenarios being looked at, by the European Commission, the OECD, etc. indicate\\nthat a recession will take hold. The main question is how long the lockdown period will last. If it\\nlasts a long time, each month will see a fall of approximately two percentage points in GDP,\\naccording to the OECD calculations. If it lasts for three months, we would see a fall of six\\npercentage points. These are fairly reliable calculations.\\nWhat do you think of the government's \\\"I order, you foot the bill\\\" approach? Meaning\\nthat employers cannot lay anyone off but have to keep paying; maintain their expenditure\\nwhile receiving no income. Could this result in the destruction of Spain's, and possibly\\nother countries', business infrastructure?\\nI mustn't get into analysing specific policies. The Spanish government has taken a decision to\\nintroduce stricter lockdown measures in the hope that this will in fact help to shorten the\\npandemic's life cycle and break the chain of infection. Ultimately, although this will come at a\\ncertain cost, hopefully it will be outweighed by the benefits. This public health crisis will lead to a\\nvery severe recession. The assumption is that businesses will stop billing. And what we must do\\nis try to keep as many of our businesses as possible afloat so that, after a certain period,\\neconomic activity can bounce back again. When companies stop billing, measures should be\\ntaken to try and keep their expenditure to a minimum. If their expenditure is fixed at a certain level,\\nthe only way out is for businesses to go bust. And that is what we must avoid.\\nThe Spanish government - I don't know about other European governments - is\\nproviding guarantees for loans to continue paying, but it's not helping businesses with a\\nmoratorium on labour costs or on certain taxes.\\nThe issue of guarantees is a crucial one. The ECB has provided lots of liquidity to the banks. The\\nbanks have to pass this liquidity on to customers, namely SMEs and the self-employed. So\\nguarantees are important. We also need to allow tax liabilities, social security payments and the\\nlike to be deferred. What's important is that businesses that were entirely profitable before the\\nstart of the pandemic survive it and become profitable again once it's over. That goes for Spain\\nand for all the countries in the euro area.\\nAre the \\u20ac120 billion of debt purchases kind of like the coronabonds that people are\\ncalling for? Or is this something different?\\nNo, this is completely different. It's direct intervention by the ECB. I'm in favour of coronabonds; I\\nthink they show solidarity.\\nWhat would coronabonds involve?\\nCoronabonds would be mutualised debt issuance by the entire euro area. They wouldn't be\\nbonds issued by Spain, Italy or Germany, but by an EU institution. But this isn't the only\\ninstrument we can use to defend [against the effects of the coronavirus], and it's certainly not the\\nmost powerful. The most powerful is undoubtedly the European Central Bank, which is dealing\\nwith a situation, in which also some countries with weaker fiscal positions require funding, so that\\nwe don't see an emergence of the bond spread problem and an increase in borrowing costs.\\nIn the 2008 crisis you were looking far ahead. Everything came together in that moment\\nduring the euro crisis. Four years went by before we could start to breathe freely. This\\ntime it's a virus which, perhaps within a month, has been brought under control in one\\nway or another. Or in two months we might be able to breathe freely again. But never\\nbefore has so much damage been done in two months. Are the consequences this time\\ngoing to be worse than back then?\\nWe will have to see. If this goes on for two months, there will be a recession but it won't be an\\noverly deep one. If we get to three months, it will start to become more serious. I think it's\\nimportant to bear in mind that, from the economic perspective, Europe remains the main\\neconomic and financial shield for an economy like Spain's in times like these, in an emergency\\nlike the one we're in now. If we didn't have a central bank like the ECB acting in the interests of\\nthe entire euro area - and in the interests of the Spanish economy - the funding costs of the\\nSpanish economy would be soaring. In a situation like the one we're in, imagine adding a debt\\ncrisis to the public health crisis and the economic crisis. That's what the ECB is preventing. So\\nthere's a significant element of solidarity to this. And other things are being done too. For\\nexample, the European Investment Bank is going to launch a guarantee scheme. The EU\\nbudgets will start working and making purchases. The EU institutions are acting in solidarity with\\nall of the countries, also those that are most vulnerable, like Spain at the moment.\\nNevertheless, the Spanish government is furious. When the Spanish Prime Minister\\ntalks about Europe, especially about Germany and the Netherlands who are putting\\nobstacles in the way of the notorious coronabonds, he looks stony-faced. Sometimes,\\nsituations like this are used somewhat irresponsibly to stir up Euroscepticism.\\nI'm not going to discuss specific topics, I will just give you the data. Currently, the ECB is clearly\\nthe principal calming influence in the financial markets, with the \\u20ac750 billion of bond purchases\\nthat we recently approved, plus the \\u20ac120 billion we approved shortly before that, plus the \\u20ac240\\nbillion we were already doing. This is ensuring that the cost of public debt, not just for Spain but\\nalso for other countries, does not increase dramatically and that the issue of bond spreads does\\nnot rear its head again.\\nTake a country with a debt level of 98% [of GDP], like Spain (not the highest in Europe,\\nsome other countries' debt levels are even higher). How many years will it take to pay off\\nthis debt increase?\\nBudgets will deteriorate significantly, mainly because tax revenues will collapse. It remains to be\\nseen who will be paying corporation tax, or VAT, or income tax, or social security contributions.\\nBut we all hope that this situation, this catastrophe, will be temporary. We're talking about two or\\nthree months. There will be an increase in debt. But what's important is that, after this period is\\nover, we get back on our feet and the Spanish economy begins generating activity and\\nemployment again, as it was before. This is very much the hope.\\nI wanted to ask you whether some of the southern European countries, and Spain in\\nparticular, could once again be looking at a rescue scenario in the medium term.\\nNo. This is completely different from what happened in 2008, 2009 and 2010. This is a shock that\\nis affecting everyone - the plans enacted in 2009 and 2010 cannot be applied to the current\\nsituation.\\nAlmost all the letters of the alphabet have been used to describe the type of recovery we\\nmight see: V-shaped, L-shaped, U-shaped... What will it be? And what is your opinion on\\nessential industries being paralysed? The accusation levelled at us by northern\\nEuropean countries is that Spain has squandered the opportunity to reduce its deficit\\nduring a growth period, and now we're paying the price.\\nSpain reduced its deficit. In 2011 we had a government deficit of 9.6% and we reduced it to 2.5%.\\nWe have a high level of debt, close to 100% [of GDP]. Spain has acted responsibly, also from the\\npoint of view of its banking sector, which is not currently a cause for concern. The sector was\\nsuccessfully restructured. And Spain is a very competitive country - the external sector is the\\nmain source of growth in the Spanish economy. The form the recovery takes will depend on how\\nthe business landscape has changed. If we can avoid a situation where many companies go\\nunder as we journey through this wilderness, I'm sure that when normal life resumes companies\\nwill start hiring again and moving in the right direction. This will make it more of a V-shaped\\nrecovery than a U-shaped one.\\nAnd what about essential industries being paralysed?\\nThat is a political decision. The government thinks that it is accelerating the flattening of the\\ninfection curve. I hope it works out. But it has an economic cost.\\nIf you were in government, would you have done the same?\\nI can't say. This crisis is unique. I think the guarantees were a good measure to take. We have to\\ntry to reduce the costs to firms and ensure that as many of them survive as possible. Because\\nthis situation will pass. It's temporary.\\nLast question: if you were a minister now, would you be in favour of a total shutdown of\\nthe economy for a short period of time?\\nI can't answer that, I'm afraid. I'm not a minister now. I was a minister for more than six years, but\\nnow I'm at the ECB. What I can tell you is that we at the ECB will do everything possible to keep\\nthe euro together and to provide the best funding possible, under the best conditions possible, to\\nthe euro area economies, including Spain.\",\n          \"Ben S Bernanke: Ceremonial swearing-in\\nRemarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\\nSystem, at the ceremonial swearing-in by President Bush, Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\\nWashington, DC, 6 February 2006.\\n* * *\\nGood morning.\\nI would like to begin by thanking President Bush for the confidence he has placed in me and for\\nattending this ceremony.

Bowman Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at \\\"Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital\\\" Spring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute New York, New York April 5, 2024 Thank you for the invitation to speak to the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC).  The SOMC has a distinguished reputation for fostering substantive analysis and debate regarding independent, transparent, and systematic approaches to central bank policymaking. It's a pleasure to join you today and to discuss some of the current issues facing central banks and monetary policymakers. In my remarks today, I will review some of the notable developments in the U.S. economy and financial system-as well as review key monetary policy actions and communications\\u2014since I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and became a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in late November 2018. As I look back over these five-plus years, I will consider how a range of uncertainties and risks regarding the macroeconomy and its measurement have affected monetary policy decisions and communications. I will also highlight some considerations regarding financial stability risks and monetary policy. I will conclude with my own views on the near-term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my outlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy. An omni-present challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for uncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when setting monetary policy. Macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary policy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output, or the neutral real interest rate. These unobservable concepts can be estimated but only with a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the estimates may vary over time-for example, because of structural changes in the economy. Macroeconomic models are also subject to uncertainty, since they must make simplifying assumptions regarding the complex set of relationships and interactions among households, businesses, governments, and the financial system that also evolve and change. Moreover, the data that are used to estimate model parameters and to formulate the economic outlook are inherently uncertain and are often revised as the statistical agencies refine their estimates or gather more information. In addition to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic models and measurement, there are a number of risks that, if realized, could shock the economy and financial system, making it more difficult for policymakers to confidently assess the economy and the economic outlook. Despite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward-looking approach, since its actions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.  The post-financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound When I joined the FOMC in late 2018, despite nearly a decade of accommodative monetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary concerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below the Committee's 2 percent inflation target. There was a recognition that the \\\"natural rate of unemployment\\\" may have been lower than many on the FOMC had estimated, and that inflation may have become less responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate.  This recognition meant that preemptive increases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone may not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the Committee's 2 percent target. A central topic of FOMC meeting discussions throughout 2019 was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment when structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept inflation persistently under the Committee's inflation target. There was also a concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC's key policy rate, was too close to the \\\"zero lower bound.\\\" And that this proximity could limit the Committee's ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate. More broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury securities. At the time, the FOMC assessed that downward risks to both employment and inflation were likely to remain prominent due to the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound. In August 2020, the FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.  A notable change relative to the initial Another notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to as \\\"asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting\\\" or \\\"temporary price level targeting.\\\"  Specifically, the new statement noted that \\\"in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at , the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\\\"  The revisions to the FOMC's statement focused on monetary policy in a world of structurally low interest rates, disinflationary forces, and an apparent insensitivity of inflation to low levels of unemployment. Although the revised statement reaffirmed the commitment to the Committee's inflation target, it did not describe how the Committee would respond if inflation were to run persistently above its 2 percent goal.  Given the timing of its implementation, the revised strategy guided how the FOMC responded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years-the COVID-19 pandemic. This shock-combined with the policy responses of governments and central banks around the world-disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the economy over the previous several decades and the post-2008 financial crisis approach to monetary policy. These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward, but let's first put the COVID-19 event and response into better context. The COVID-19 shock and monetary policy response Toward the latter part of the FOMC's monetary policy framework review, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and financial system. Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing, combined with other pandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced significant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid shutdown of the U.S. economy (and I'll have more to say on this topic later). As a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal funds rate back to 0 to $1 / 4$ percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functioning of securities markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households. Later, the purchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.  Following the return to the zero lower bound, in addition to conducting asset purchases, the FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep both short- and longer-term interest rates low. In its March 15, 2020, statement, the FOMC noted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to $1 / 4$ percent \\\"until it  on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\\\"10 Following the release of the revised framework in August 2020, the FOMC revised the forward guidance in its September post-meeting statement to be more explicitly outcome-based to state that the target range would remain at 0 to $1 / 4$ percent \\\"until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\\\"11 In its December 2020 post-meeting statement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting that it expected that the current pace of asset purchases would continue until \\\"substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\\\"12 This explicit outcome-based forward guidance, like the revised monetary policy framework, was very focused on supporting the economy following the COVID-19 shock amid the risks of persistently low inflation and disinflationary forces with structurally low interest rates. The guidance was also quite restrictive in the criteria for slowing the pace of asset purchases, especially since the FOMC would stop asset purchases before it would raise the federal funds rate.  One could argue the December forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. Other uncertainties such as the accuracy of real-time economic measurements also presented challenges, as did significant supply-side disruptions and the uncertainty about the timing of progress toward their resolution, which I will discuss next. The post-pandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in monetary policy In the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented support programs for labor markets and households and businesses.  These generous policies, combined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and state and local government balance sheets. In particular, they led to what has come to be known as \\\"excess savings\\\"-above-normal household savings from extraordinary levels of fiscal support and a limited ability to freely spend it due to economic lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and other pandemic- and recession-related factors. In 2021, novel medical treatments, reduced social distancing, and innovative business approaches in adapting to the restrictive pandemic environment led to a sharp economic rebound. Strong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply (due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID-19), and a mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic-driven shift to consumer goods spending, supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component shortages led to crippling bottlenecks for a number of industries. These supply and demand imbalances, likely amplified by fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over a period of just a few months. By the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broadbased. Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of tightness, given the decrease in labor force participation and mixed data signals at the time, which all were later revised. Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most important was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply-side issues eventually eased. The September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the end of 2021, largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021. But for year-end 2022, the median expectation was for PCE inflation to decline to 2.2 percent.  With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time, with 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022. This example underscores the challenge we faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would persist. In the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. It seems likely to me that the experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change. Of course, the inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.  Together, these factors, combined with the FOMC's forward guidance discussed earlier, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021. The shift in the Committee's forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022 was effective in moving longer-dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial conditions, even before the FOMC raised the federal funds rate.  The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate over the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became clear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had expected. By July 2023, the FOMC had increased the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 percentage points, and into restrictive territory, where it has remained. And we have continued to reduce the size of our securities holdings. The monetary policy experience during the pandemic highlights how difficult it can be to assess the current state of the economy and to predict how it will evolve in the presence of major supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real-time data and measurement uncertainty. An important question I will be thinking about going forward is how to make monetary policy decisions and communications more robust to these types of risks. We know that monetary policy transmission is most effective during periods of stable financial conditions, and that financial stability risks, if realized, can affect the economic outlook. While monetary policy and financial stability are connected, financial stability vulnerabilities and risks are most appropriately addressed using macro- and micro-prudential regulation and bank supervision. During periods of extreme financial stress, well-calibrated lending and liquidity programs can be used to address such conditions. Of course, where risks impact the outlook for economic activity, employment, and inflation, a monetary policy response may also be required. The Federal Reserve's use of liquidity and lending programs during the early stages of the pandemic demonstrated the effectiveness of emergency lending tools as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit in times of stress.  Lending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term. This experience also highlights the importance of clearly distinguishing monetary policy actions from temporary central bank asset purchase programs used to promote core financial market functioning, like those created to support Treasury markets in the spring of $2020 .{ }^{21}$ More recently, the bank failures last spring highlight that responsive, efficient, and effective bank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities. The failures revealed that shortcomings in bank supervision can heighten financial stability risks. The primary focus of supervision should be to address a bank's critical shortcomings in a timely way.  To effectively support financial stability, bank supervision cannot simply rely on pinpointing compliance issues, failed processes, or rule violations. It must go further to examine a bank's risk exposures, including anticipating how the evolving economic environment may influence a bank's financial condition and its assessment of risks. If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, like excess interest rate risk and disproportionately large levels of uninsured deposits, this raises the potential for safety and soundness concerns. Last year's bank stress also revealed that the Fed's bank liquidity and payments toolsincluding the Fed's discount window operations and FedWire\\u00ae-should be available for extended operating hours and prepared to provide support during times of stress. We should also consider what further steps may be needed to ensure that banks have access to liquidity support. In addition, we should encourage, but not mandate, the exercise of contingency funding plans and testing capabilities, requiring bank management to ensure adequate plans are in place.  But there is a fine line between bank supervision and interfering in the decisions of bank management. Some measure of risk is inherent and necessary in the business of banking. While some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote financial stability, we should be cautious that these changes do not impair the long-term viability of banks, especially mid-sized and smaller banks.  Looking ahead, the FOMC will continue to face a number of risks and uncertainties as it seeks to return inflation to its 2 percent goal. It will be important to evaluate how these uncertainties and risks affect our monetary policy decisions going forward. As this audience knows, members of the FOMC consult a range of models that consider several scenarios and their potential economic outcomes using different benchmark monetary policy rules.  This type of analysis can provide helpful input in informing my own views on the appropriate path of monetary policy. Given the importance of transparency, it is also necessary that our communications explain not only how the economic outlook affects our monetary policy decisions, often referred to as the FOMC's \\\"reaction function,\\\" but also how the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook matter for those decisions. With that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with my own views on the near-term economic outlook, including some prominent risks and uncertainties, and the implications for monetary policy. At our most recent FOMC meeting, I supported keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at $5-1 / 4$ to $5-1 / 2$ percent and continuing to reduce our securities holdings. At its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. We have seen significant progress on lowering inflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong. Consumer services spending has shown continued strength through February, and payroll employment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter. However, most employment gains over the past year have been in part-time employment, and some of the recent strength in job gains may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased immigration. The 12-month readings of total and core PCE inflation through February printed at 2.5 and 2.8 percent, respectively, much lower than a year ago. However, with the annualized 3-month PCE inflation readings moving well-above the 12-month measures in February, I expect further progress in bringing inflation down to 2 percent will be slower this year. Still, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong but with labor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declines. And should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation. First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation. For example, the rebound in labor productivity last year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemic-related labor market dynamics, such as a slowing in the high levels of employee turnover during that time. Therefore, if wage gains remain elevated going forward, these effects may no longer contribute to lower price inflation in the future. Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences. Another upside inflation risk I see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spend-out rate from existing and new appropriations. Although some of the recent policies may increase productive capacity in the medium term, they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting aggregate demand. I also see upside risks to housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of available and affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to certain regions could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. There is also a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could lead to persistently higher core services inflation. Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services. Finally, there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment. In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy, like higher investment demand relative to available savings, it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the pandemic. If that is the case, fewer rate cuts will eventually be appropriate to return our monetary policy stance to a neutral level. In the most recent SEP, some FOMC participants indicated that they now see fewer rate cuts over 2024 and over the next two years than in December. Some also included a higher longer-run level of the federal funds rate than in the past.  While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run. To conclude, the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of setting forward-looking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties. Taking into account this experience and the lessons I have learned over my tenure on the FOMC, an important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy strategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy. We will continue to learn about the post-pandemic economy, and, if history is any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably occur. While the future is full of risks and uncertainties, the FOMC's mandate of fostering price stability and maximum employment remains very clear. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to our conversation.\",\n          \"Interview with Ms Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in To Vima (Greek daily newspaper), conducted by Mr Angelos Athanasopoulos and published on 4 April 2020. The ECB recently decided to unleash its firepower once more to protect the euro area economy. The introduction of the $\\u20ac 750$ billion pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) is the latest in a series of measures, with the ECB having already announced an additional envelope for its asset purchase programme of $\\u20ac 120$ billion in net purchases until the end of 2020, on top of the monthly net asset purchases of $\\u20ac 20$ billion. Why was an ad hoc, temporary programme like the PEPP needed? The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a humanitarian crisis, and has put enormous strain on the euro area economy and the financial sector. Over the past few weeks, the outlook for the economy deteriorated sharply as countries had to intensify containment measures, dampening both production and consumption. This posed downside risks to the inflation outlook in the euro area. We also observed a sharp tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy needed support. Signs of financial fragmentation were re-emerging, impairing the transmission of our policy. We responded forcefully to this deterioration in the economic outlook by launching a new temporary asset purchase programme, the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which also includes purchases of Greek government bonds. This helps stabilise financial markets, and contributes to much more favourable financing conditions, not least in Greece, where interest rate spreads have dropped markedly. What are the main characteristics of the PEPP? Would you say that it is different from a typical monetary quantitative easing (QE) programme? If so, what are the differences? Our existing asset purchase programme (APP) was designed for normal times, providing monetary policy accommodation in order to support the gradual return of inflation to our aim. The PEPP is a separate programme. It is our response to the extraordinary economic shock caused by the pandemic. The PEPP is temporary, significant in size, and flexible. We expect it to run until we judge that the current crisis is over, but at least until the end of the year. One of the key aspects of the PEPP is its flexibility. How do you respond to those who say that the ECB should not raise the issue limit of $33 \\\\%$ when buying bonds? Could this raise legal questions in the future? The ECB has made it clear that, within its mandate, it will do everything needed in order to safeguard the full transmission of its monetary policy in all euro area countries. The PEPP allows purchases to be conducted flexibly over time and across asset classes and jurisdictions. The Governing Council has explicitly communicated that, if necessary and proportionate to the extraordinary risks that we are facing due to the coronavirus crisis, it will consider revising any self-imposed limits, including the issue share and issuer limits, in line with our legal framework. This flexibility makes the PEPP a highly effective instrument to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy and to avoid fragmentation across euro area countries. The ECB granted a waiver which allows it to purchase Greek bonds under the PEPP. What does this move signal to the markets? How important is this development, and could it later open the door to Greece participating in the normal asset purchase programme? Greece has made impressive progress in recent years, after many years of economic and social hardship. The economy was on an encouraging trajectory before the pandemic, and the Greek authorities have responded decisively to the health crisis. By including Greek bonds in the PEPP, the ECB is sending a clear signal to markets that this crisis affects the entire euro area, and that it will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in any euro area country. The ECB will do everything that is necessary to fulfil its mandate and support the euro area and its citizens through this historic crisis. If Greece is included in an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL) programme, along the lines described in Eurogroup President Mario Centeno's recent letter to the European Council, would it then be eligible for the public sector purchase programme (PSPP)? Greece does not yet satisfy the minimum rating requirement for eligibility for outright purchases under the PSPP. Under certain conditions, a waiver to these requirements can be granted. It also depends on political decisions and on the specific features of any potential credit line instrument that is being considered by the relevant European institutions, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The PEPP also allows for the purchase of corporate bonds. What is the situation for Greek corporate bonds? Are they included in the PEPP? Can they be included in the future? In principle, non-financial corporate bonds issued in any euro area country, including Greece, can be included in the PEPP if they meet the relevant eligibility requirements, including the minimum rating threshold. For the time being, no Greek corporate bonds qualify. But I hope that this will change in the future. Over the past decade, prudential issues such as non-performing loans (NPLs) have been very challenging to deal with. NPLs have been one of the main structural problems in the Greek banking sector, preventing investment and growth in the Greek economy. As the euro area economy is heading towards a recession, which could prove long and deep, a new generation of NPLs could appear - and not only in Greece. How is the ECB planning to deal with such a contingency? Will the plans put in place to deal with the current challenge of NPLs be enough when the coronavirus crisis comes to an end? The crisis will certainly have negative effects on bank balance sheets. But this time, banks are not the cause of the crisis; they rather have to be part of the solution. And they are in much better shape now, with more capital and a better liquidity position. The supervisory arm of the ECB has implemented significant measures to allow banks to continue to provide funding to firms and households. ECB Banking Supervision has communicated to banks that it will use maximum flexibility in evaluating the progress of ongoing plans to reduce past NPLs. It is important that we find the right balance between helping banks absorb the impact of the current downturn and identifying risks, deploy sustainable solutions for viable distressed debtors. Only a strong, but at the same time sufficiently flexible, banking system is able to meet the financing needs of people and businesses. Christine Lagarde has mentioned that aside from what the ECB can and will do, the Member States of the euro area should assume their responsibilities on the fiscal side. The ESM is exploring various options towards that end, although differences among Member States remain. Would the ECB consider eurobonds in the form of \\\"coronabonds\\\" as a proper way forward in order for the euro area economy to counter These are political decisions, which are not within the ECB's remit. That being said, there is clearly a need to provide European-level support to those euro area countries hit most by the crisis. This is not just a question of European solidarity, but also makes sense from an economic standpoint. Mitigating the negative economic effects of the crisis in each Member State and supporting the recovery afterwards makes the whole of Europe stronger. The issuance of one-off \\\"coronabonds\\\" is one possibility. There are other instruments that could be used, like an EU rescue fund or measures involving the ESM or the European Investment Bank. In the current crisis, the PEPP is the right instrument to support the euro area on the monetary policy side. Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) were designed to address a different contingency: the risk that the expectations of a euro area break-up might become self-fulfilling. OMT's remain an essential element of our policy toolkit, but they are not the most suitable instrument to counter the current crisis.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"current_rate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.8948342552132622,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 6.54,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 166,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.75,\n          2.13\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"next_rate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.7486900544249446,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 6.54,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 165,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2.13,\n          0.9\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"next_rate_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 274,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2001-04-01\",\n          \"2013-10-01\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rate_difference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3271691634418521,\n        \"min\": -0.96,\n        \"max\": 0.75,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 114,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.12,\n          0.0199999999999995\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"previous_rate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.8948106855186861,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 6.54,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 166,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.75,\n          2.13\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rate_change_direction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"no change\",\n          \"increase\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"days_to_next_decision\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 669.118621807574,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 3051.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1176,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2780.0,\n          296.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 1999,\n        \"max\": 2025,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2007,\n          2012\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"role\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"president\",\n          \"executive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

References for this speech can be found on the US Federal Reserve Systems's website. I am honored to participate in this tribute to Otmar Issing. I have known and admired Otmar for some time. It has been a source of great pride that he has considered me a worthy intellectual sparing partner over the years. From the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the restaurants of Frankfurt and at many conferences in between, we have challenged each other to state our assumptions, examine the evidence, and adjust our conclusions accordingly. I have derived enormous benefit from that give-and-take-a sentiment, I am sure, that many others in this room share. I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late-namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy. Otmar and I have debated this issue on many occasions, and these discussions-together with recent research carried out at the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and elsewhere-have been both challenging and stimulating. The preparation of this talk has afforded me a welcome opportunity to reexamine my thinking on this subject. So, today, I will review the arguments and the evidence as I see them and draw out the conclusions to which I am currently led. At the outset, let me stress that I will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Most fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation. But many argue that pronounced booms and busts in asset markets are another matter, especially if actual valuations appear to be misaligned with fundamentals. What should a central bank do when it suspects it faces a major speculative event-one that might be large enough to threaten economic stability when it unwinds? To help frame the discussion, I will focus on two different strategies that have been proposed for dealing with market bubbles. The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy-calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years. Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term. Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process. Following this strategy does not imply that policymakers ignore the expected future evolution of speculative activity. If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations. Practically speaking, however, I view our ability to act on such suspicions as limited given how little we know about the dynamics of speculative episodes. Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices-indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation. It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings. The second strategy, by comparison, is more activist and attempts to damp speculative activity directly. It was described at length in \\\"Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy,\\\" an article published by the ECB last year. I quote from the article: \\\"This approach amounts to a cautious policy of 'leaning against the wind' of an incipient bubble. The central bank would adopt a somewhat tighter policy stance in the face of an inflating asset market than it would otherwise allow if confronted with a similar macroeconomic outlook under more normal market conditions. . . . It would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future.\\\" Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble. Thus, the strategy seeks to trade off the near-certainty of worse macroeconomic performance today for the chance of disproportionally better performance in the future, on the theory that the repercussions of a major market correction could be highly nonlinear. But the extra-action proposal is by no means a bold call for central banks to prick market bubbles. As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession. Rather, the extra-action strategy is intended only to provide some limited insurance against the possibility of highly adverse events occurring down the road. I will be talking at length about the differences between the two strategies, but I must stress up front how much they have in common. Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework. Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies. At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level. Of course, we may not be prepared to write down a specific loss function and say, \\\"There, that's what I'm minimizing.\\\" But our deliberative processes and our actions seem broadly consistent with that characterization of the general problem. This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area. Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well. We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is marketdetermined and easily liquified. Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending. Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services. Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending. In cases of sharply falling market valuations, these adverse credit-channel effects may even be exacerbated by the deteriorating health of banks and other financial institutions. In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time. Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts. In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass. While no one uses formal Bayesian methods to solve this difficult problem, I think most policymakers do engage in at least an informal weighing of the various possibilities and their implications when setting policy. Now let me turn from areas of agreement to more contentious issues, ones that have a strong bearing on the relative merits of the two strategies. As the ECB article notes, extra action is often seen as a type of insurance. And as with any insurance policy, before you buy you have to ask whether the expected benefits outweigh the costs. As I see it, extra action pays only if three tough conditions are met. First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, there must be a fairly high probability that a modestly tighter policy will help to check the further expansion of speculative activity. And finally, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from a less expansive bubble must be sizable. You may be thinking that, in stating the three conditions, I have slanted the case with such phrases as \\\"reasonable confidence\\\" and \\\"fairly high probability.\\\" But stick with me, and I hope to persuade you that these probabilistic qualifiers are needed to judge the merits of extra action. For the moment, let me set aside the first condition and assume that central banks can distinguish an emerging bubble from improving fundamentals at an early stage. What about the other two conditions? Should we presume that a limited application of restrictive policy would materially restrain the speculative boom and make its eventual unwinding less disruptive for the overall economy? Consider the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-to-late 1990s. The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits-fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices. How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future. In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals. But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies. At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects. In general, we have a very poor understanding of the forces driving speculative bubbles and the role played by monetary policy. In fact, we cannot rule out perverse effects. Again, consider the U.S. experience of the late 1990s. When the FOMC tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell-perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained. Since mid-2004, we have seen a marked decline in bond-term premiums, even as the funds rate has risen steadily. These episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction. However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble. Even then, with the second condition now met, the third condition might not hold: The expected improvement in future macroeconomic performance from moderating the bubble's expansion may not be enough to more than offset the upfront costs of extra action. To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future. Admittedly, if the worst-outcome scenario associated with an unchecked bubble is judged sufficiently dire and if the scenario is not seen as too improbable, then a risk-averse policymaker might regard the expected return from extra action insurance as worth its upfront cost. However, our confidence in such an assessment would seem to hinge on believing that the effects of market corrections could be markedly nonlinear. Proponents of extra action often cite an increased risk of severe financial distress as a potential source of such effects. However, without the onset of deflation, how large is this risk? In recent history, the health of the U.S. financial system remained solid after the collapse of the high-tech boom, despite the bankruptcy of dozens of telecom and dot-com firms, the loss of more than $\\\\$ 8$ trillion in stock market wealth, and stress in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Moreover, the financial sectors of most other developed economies also weathered the worldwide drop in corporate equity values fairly well. Of course, the nonlinear risks associated with a collapsing bubble may depend on the initial health of the financial system, and under some circumstances we could be worried about the potential for significant financial distress to accompany the bursting of a bubble, should that bubble expand further. Even in such cases, however, I wonder whether good prudential supervision in advance and prompt action to clean up any lingering structural problems afterward would not be better ways to deal with this possibility. Certainly, closer oversight of banking systems during the 1980s, including the United States, would have left many economies in a stronger position during the early 1990s. This lesson has been absorbed by supervisory authorities around the world, as evidenced by our successful efforts to strengthen bank capital and our financial systems. I do agree that market corrections can have profoundly adverse consequences if they lead to deflation, as illustrated by the United States after the 1929 stock market crash and the more recent experience of Japan. But it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses. In Japan, deflation could probably have been avoided if the initial monetary response to the slump in real estate and stock market values had been more aggressive; in addition, macroeconomic performance would have been better if the government had dealt more promptly with the structural problems of the banking sector. As for the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve actually worsened the situation by allowing the money supply to contract sharply in 1930 and 1931, after unwisely attempting to prick the stock market bubble in the first place. Rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound. By doing so, policymakers should be able to avoid the severe nonlinear dynamics of deflation. Proponents of extra action often argue that it should reduce the risk of hitting the zero bound, but we should recognize that under some circumstances extra action may actually exacerbate the problem. To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts. Now the central bank contemplates taking extra action. In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small. In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand. With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts. Under these conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expected economic performance, not improve it. Another purported benefit of extra action is that, by raising the cost of capital to firms and households, it helps reduce overinvestment fostered during speculative booms, thereby making it easier for the economy to recover after the bubble collapses. However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the macroeconomic importance of such capital mis-allocation. True, the U.S. high-tech boom led to overinvestment in some sectors, wasting resources and creating lingering difficulties while capital overhangs were eliminated. But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years. Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals. Thus, mitigating capital misallocation in one sector would have created capital misallocations elsewhere, making the assessment of the net gain from extra action difficult. And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation. Now I would like to return to the first condition, the one I sidestepped a few minutes ago--the question of identifying market bubbles in a timely fashion. The EOB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate. For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain. Under extra action, mistakenly identifying a bubble has significant costs. By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose. Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses. But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time. And the mistaken call would have reduced welfare by needlessly inducing fluctuations in the macroeconomy. Timing is also an issue. Let us suppose that the evidence is so compelling that policymakers become fairly confident that valuations are excessively rich. Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability. The market correction could occur with policy in a tighter position but before extra action had enough time to materially influence speculative activity. Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits. Such talk might do some good by prompting investors to stop and rethink their assumptions. And talk by itself should not do much lasting harm even if valuations turn out to be justified--provided, however, that words are not seen as precursors to action under circumstances in which conventional policy would still be the best approach. To wrap up this critique, I summarize as follows: If we can identify bubbles quickly and accurately, are reasonably confident that tighter policy would materially check their expansion, and believe that severe market corrections have significant non-linear adverse effects on the economy, then extra action may well be merited. But if even one of these tough conditions is not met, then extra action would be more likely to lead to worse macroeconomic performance over time than that achievable with conventional policies that deal expeditiously with the effects of the unwinding of the bubbles when they occur. For my part, I am dubious that any central banker knows enough about the economy to overcome these hurdles. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances, or perhaps at some point in the future when our understanding of asset markets and the economy has increased, such a course of action would be appropriate. Proponents of extra action have their own bones to pick with the conventional strategy, especially as it relates to the alleged asymmetric nature of the policy's response to asset market booms and busts. In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC's actions over the past twenty years, the Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems. This argument strikes me as a misreading of history. U.S. monetary policy has responded symmetrically to the implications of asset-price movements for actual and projected developments in output and inflation, consistent with its mandate. The most convincing evidence for this statement can be found in the results: Interest rates have been consistent with underlying inflation remaining reasonably stable for some time now, accompanied by relatively mild fluctuations in real activity. Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk. Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a \\\"Greenspan put,\\\" stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy. Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were. The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions. Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves. Ironically, one can argue that extra action may pose a more significant risk of moral hazard. It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some \\\"appropriate\\\" level. How does this strategy play out if a central bank takes extra action and speculative activity continues unabated or even intensifies? Do policymakers raise rates even further above levels consistent with conventional policy and, if so, at what consequences for the economy? And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices? If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase? My remarks today have been intended as a salute to Otmar and to all the valuable contributions he has made over the years to my thinking and to that of policymakers around the world. Otmar, you have taught me much about intellectual rigor in support of central bank contributions to economic welfareand about friendship. Weighing the relative merits of extra action and conventional policy is not easy and requires a nuanced interpretation of the arguments and the evidence, as well as some hard thinking. Otmar and his colleagues have done this in advancing the case for extra action, and by so doing they have given me a good intellectual workout--and Otmar, I thank you for that. I hope my response has provided a good workout in return. I look forward to continuing the debate and especially the friendship for many years to come.\",\n          \"Interview with Mr Beno\\u00eet Coeur\\u00e9, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in Delo, conducted by Mr Miha Jenko and published on 15 February 2014. Beno\\u00eet C\\u0153ur\\u00e9: Over the last 16 months, Slovenia has been through a very difficult period, with many serious challenges both from an economic and also from a financial standpoint. The Slovenian authorities have acknowledged and understood the challenges and have been addressing them in a systematic and serious way. The first appropriate and important steps have been taken, in particular when it comes to the restructuring of the banking sector. By completing the asset quality review and the stress tests they have reached a milestone, allowing for the restructuring of the banking system. But there remains a lot to be done. Both the Slovenian government and Banka Slovenije have a very good understanding of what has to be done. This relates to three key issues. The first is financial sector restructuring. This is well advanced. The asset quality review and the stress tests have been important and have been done in a serious and professional way, but this is only the first step. From now on you need a comprehensive reform of the banking system as part of a broader strategy for the entire economy. In this respect there are quite a few further steps to be taken. Second, there is the fiscal dimension, where you need to bring down the fiscal deficit, but it is also very important to bring down the public debt. In this respect, Slovenia must observe the recommendations issued by the European Commission regarding the reduction of the structural deficit. This fiscal effort should be aimed towards a visible reduction in the debt level. And the third aspect is obviously economic reform and improving the efficiency of the economy. No other effort will be successful if the economy does not become more efficient. Yes, the IMF has also warned Slovenia in its latest report about the risk of rapidly increasing public debt which could soon go beyond the hard-to-manage level of 85\\\\%. What are the necessary steps to reduce this risk of unmanageable public debt and high interest rate costs? One of the key policy actions is privatisation, which can be very useful both to improve the efficiency of the companies and banks and also to reduce Slovenia's debt level. Slovenian banks were subject recently to a very strict and a very conservative review by auditing companies Roland Berger and Oliver Wyman. In the end, there was the impression that we are forced to apply the most extreme, the most pessimistic and the most costly scenario as calculated by Oliver Wyman. Do you agree? I don't want to pass a judgement on the stress test itself which was done by the Slovenian authorities. In principle we are in favour of a strict approach to the stress tests. It is important to be on the safe side, to be prepared for the future and it is important that the banks are sound again so that they can lend to companies. So recapitalising banks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment in the future, so that banks can extend new loans to the economy. Slovenia has to address its banking legacy issues and be on the safe side. Are you also going to support such a strict, conservative approach this year when 128 key European banks will be analysed? Are these banks going to be examined as rigorously as ours? Absolutely, it will be the same philosophy. We will discuss all the parameters with the 18 supervisors - the so-called \\\"national competent authorities\\\" of the 18 euro area countries - within the ECB's new Supervisory Board, which met for the first time on 30 January. This will be the place where all the assumptions, parameters and choices will be discussed. This will be the first important contribution made by the Single Supervisory Mechanism to the euro area. The principles will be the same and they will be very strict, to make sure that we know everything about the situation of the banks this time - and to be sure that measures are taken to prepare for the future. Several critical reviews of the Oliver Wyman financial consultancy appeared recently in the foreign press. Why has the ECB decided to use Oliver Wyman, of all companies, to carry out such a demanding task and what were the selection criteria? There was an open, competitive selection process and Oliver Wyman came first. Taxpayers in Slovenia have paid over $\\u20ac 3$ billion, nearly 9\\\\% of GDP, for the recapitalisation of troubled state-owned banks alone. Banks are now full of capital. But on the other hand they are not lending money to companies for their working capital and investments. How do you see this controversy? Part of the explanation has to do with the weakness of aggregate demand not only in Slovenia but also across the euro area. Slovenia is a very open economy, selling a lot to European markets. The overall weakness of growth in the euro area also weighs on Slovenia. Now, it is true that the low level of ECB rates today translates very slowly to the real economy. This is happening in many countries and it is not specific to Slovenia. It will improve over time as we see convergence in the euro area and as we see reforms being implemented in the countries. And this you can already see taking place in Slovenia in the decrease in yields on the sovereign bond market. There has been a significant improvement in the long-term interest rates on bond markets. Slovenia is one of the best performers in the euro area in terms of decreasing bond yields, so that's a sign that convergence is taking place. It takes time to feed into the real economy but it will happen; things are going in the right direction. I think the priority currently is not really the Keynesian one. In Slovenia, the priority is to make the economy more efficient, both in the private sector and in the public sector. This also means that some companies should be moved from the public sector to the private sector through privatisation. This will happen and it will also benefit the debt level. Some enterprises will remain in the public sector - but their efficiency must also be improved. All the efforts that are being made today by the government and by Banka Slovenije to restore the soundness of the banking system are not going to achieve their goals, meaning to support growth and employment, if the economy does not work better. It is good to inject capital into banks, but if banks are facing projects that are not profitable they will be creating bad loans and make losses and the capital will be burnt. So it is very important that, alongside the restructuring and recapitalisation of banks, efforts are made to restructure the economy and to make it more profitable. That is also the recommendation of the European Commission to all countries and in particular to Slovenia in the so-called Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. It is important that this is respected. Haircutting the subordinated debt in Slovenian banks attracted a lot of public attention and even anger in recent months in Slovenia. Why was it necessary to perform this haircut in Slovenia, but not, for instance, in Ireland or other countries? This is not specific to Slovenia. Europe has learned the lessons from the past crises and has adopted a principle of responsibility for investors in bank bonds. All investors who put their money in these bonds have to know that they will be part of the effort if anything bad happens because bonds are an investment, not a deposit. These are the bail-in rules that have been decided by the European authorities and are intended to protect taxpayers, who should not be responsible for the situation of banks. When saving a bank, taxpayers should come last, with shareholders coming first, followed by bond owners. This distribution of responsibilities is now clear. This is not a decision of the ECB, it is a decision of the European Council and the Commission, but one that we support. True, but the decision is very recent and people didn't know before that something like that could happen at all. Slovenia is not the first case. It has already happened in Spain, for instance. But it's a change in the regime, with the aim that taxpayers and depositors are better protected and are not liable for the errors committed by banks. The BAMC had a good start. It has built up expertise and human capital, started operating and has already been receiving a first batch of bad loans. It now needs to continue its work and to receive the next instalment of bad assets, subject to the authorisation by the European Commission. Secondly, it needs to continue building up the institution itself so that it is credible and independent. It is not only about restructuring the banking sector but also about making the Slovenian economy function better. Bad loans are loans to the economy. For this reason, the BAMC should take decisions that are in the interest of Slovenian taxpayers and of the Slovenian people. It should keep resisting vested interests. For this purpose it has to be independent and in this way it will best protect the interests of taxpayers and workers in Slovenia. The good news is that Moody's has just increased the ratings of the recently recapitalised Slovenian banks. What should be done now by these banks to ensure further improvement of their ratings so that they can improve their access to funding and extend loans on favourable conditions? Beyond the ratings, what matters for Slovenia is the renewed trust of financial markets and investors, and the ultimate goal would be for these banks to be able to diversify their funding sources in the market, which would make them more resilient, and in turn support the Slovenian economy. Their objective should be to access to stable funding in financial markets. Banks should now properly manage their loan books and make adequate provisions, if necessary. But ultimately what matters most will be profitable projects in the economy. And this does not depend so much on the banks but also on the government, which needs to ensure a more efficient public sector, and on reforming the economy so that it is more efficient and able to thrive in the European environment. The key to success, therefore, lies in the real economy, not in the financial sector. I agree. Slovenia's economy generates nearly 70\\\\% of GDP from exports. What is the ECB's assessment of our main trading partners, Germany, France, Austria and Italy? Could we expect more demand from these countries this year? Certainly demand in the largest European economies is steadily improving. This is obviously not enough, but growth is positive again and it is accelerating. All the recent signs from the economy across Europe suggest that this scenario is again taking place. It is a scenario of a slow but steadily improving growth, also in the larger European economies. So demand from these economies is picking up and improving, and should benefit smaller, very open economies such as Slovenia. So there is ground for optimism. The euro area is going in the right direction. Two years ago, maybe even one year ago we didn't have this direction, this steady and improving growth. Certainly it is not enough and everything should be done to prop it up - but it is very important to know what the direction is. So is the euro safe now after some very turbulent years when there was even speculation it might break up? Is the euro on the safe side now, out of the worst trouble? The euro is no longer being challenged as a project. This is an important achievement. European policy-makers have confirmed their commitment to the single currency project and to the integrity of the euro area and this has restored trust in the euro in international capital markets. This is why many international investors are now coming to the euro area - it's a sign of trust in the reform process here. That's good news. What remains very challenging is growth, which is too low, and it should be Europe's priority to support it not only in countries with adjustment programmes but also in all other euro area countries. This cannot be achieved through additional public spending but through additional investment. All countries have to restore a climate of confidence that will be conducive to investment, and this includes large economies such as Germany, France and Italy. According to the latest figures, the inflation rate in the euro area has dropped as low as $0.7 \\\\%$, the lowest level in years. How serious is the problem of deflation for the ECB? The Governing Council's assumption is that the rate of inflation will gradually increase towards our target of close to, but below, $2 \\\\%$. We are however closer to the area where inflation expectations could be altered and create downside risks to price stability. So we are very vigilant regarding risks to our baseline scenario, which envisages inflation slowly going back to $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. This is our primary mandate and we take it very seriously. At its last meeting, the Governing Council firmly reiterated our forward guidance, whereby we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. We remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation that is appropriate for the euro area economy, and will not hesitate to take further decisive action if required. Inflation being below $2 \\\\%$ and close to $2 \\\\%$ is the definition of price stability that the ECB has chosen. In the uncertain environment with the euro area in transition and the participating economies undergoing a lot of structural change, it is very important that the ECB sticks to its inflation objective and maintains its credibility as an anchor for the reform efforts in Europe. The reason why the $2 \\\\%$ number has been chosen is that this is a level that is neither too high nor too low. We know that inflation which is too high can be detrimental for the economy as it can lead to destabilising feedback loops, for instance, through wage settlements and price indexation, and ultimately erode trust in the currency. But very low inflation can also be destabilising. That's why inflation which is too low is also contrary to price stability as it can create a self-fulfilling spiral of expectations that prices will continue falling. That would discourage households from consuming and companies would stop investing. This is the definition of deflation. So we want to be in the safe area between high inflation and deflation, and below but close to $2 \\\\%$ is exactly the right level. Note that since 1998, when this number was chosen, most of the major central banks around the world have converged towards the same number: it has been adopted by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and most recently by the Bank of Japan. Such steadily increasing prices do not distort economic choices. My personal definition of price stability is a rate of inflation which does not distort economic behaviour. To come back to Slovenian issues: our authorities have taken the decision to avoid using the ESM funds, which also carry certain conditionality. Based on the philosophy that we will solve our problems by ourselves, we have also tried to sell bonds in the US market. What is your view of that? Would it be better for Slovenia to return to the euro market and issue euro-denominated bonds? After all, we are a euro area country. I don't have any advice to give to your finance minister. He certainly does what is in the best interest of Slovenian taxpayers. In the medium term, stable funding for the Slovenian budget would benefit from a mix of dollar issuance and euro issuance. But so far the funding strategy has been successful. The biggest opposition party in Slovenia has proposed changes in central bank legislation to allow a representative of the political opposition to attend sessions of the Governing Board of Banka Slovenije. Is this proposal in line with ECB policies? We are in the process of looking at that particular proposal but it is clear that in every euro area country, small or large, the independence of the national central bank has to be ensured. According to one estimate, the 128 largest European banks which will undergo the asset quality review and stress test this year will require up to $\\u20ac 500$ billion of additional capital. Is this a manageable amount? It is absolutely premature to comment on any number. We are at the start of the process, getting organised and collecting the data. Once these tests have been completed, will European taxpayers be on the safe side? Will they have any guarantee that such a banking crisis will never happen again? The best safeguard to make sure that the banking crisis doesn't happen again is tough supervision, which will be ensured through the Single Supervisory Mechanism that will start operating in November. This is the best protection. The ECB, as the single supervisor in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, will have to be tough. Together with the new banking rules, this will be the best way of preventing future crises. I very much believe that taxpayers are now much better protected than they were before the crisis, in particular thanks to the new bail-in rules that make sure that investors in banks will be the first to cover any losses. If any capital shortfall is identified by the ECB stress test and asset quality review, it will have to be covered first by the private sector. The ECB has had a very clear role since May 2010, when we were invited to join the troika and advise the European Commission on matters where we have specific expertise. Those are generally financial sector issues, the situation of banks and also the general macroeconomic balance. This has been our role, but otherwise all the decisions related to financial support to countries have been taken by the Eurogroup and by the countries themselves. The Eurogroup is the politically and democratically accountable authority. Key decisions can only be taken by authorities, or politicians who are accountable to their parliaments. Decisions on reforms in individual countries can only be taken by local governments under the scrutiny of national parliaments. The work of the troika has to be accountable to democratic institutions. The ECB can explain what it does in the troika, but we only act as an adviser. The ECB is this year moving to a beautiful new building in Frankfurt. How many people will work in the new building and what will change with the move? The ECB's new building is a long-term project. All of our staff, some 1600 people, except those in charge of banking supervision, will move to the new building. The new banking supervisory body within the ECB will be located in another building in the centre of Frankfurt because its staff have to be together. It is also good that the monetary policy part of the ECB and the supervisory part are separated, as they are two different functions. The Governing Council has confirmed its main scenario of a steady recovery, with inflation gradually moving back towards our policy objective of below, but close to, $2 \\\\%$ over the medium term. As explained by President Draghi, we didn't see enough reasons for policy action at our last meeting. Over the next weeks and months, if risks to our main scenario materialise, we will be ready to act, consistent with our forward guidance.\",\n          \"Speech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the \\\"Annual Danish Top Executive Summit 2013\\\", Copenhagen, 29 January 2013. It is a real pleasure for me to share some thoughts today with such a distinguished group of business leaders. It may strike you as somewhat paradoxical for a central banker to address such an audience in a conference where the main theme is innovative thinking. After all, central bankers have traditionally been stereotyped as conservative and, well, rather dull. I firmly believe, though, that in a constantly changing world, decision-makers need to develop and maintain a healthy degree of scepticism around whether their current strategies and practices remain fit-for-purpose. This holds for decision-makers in business as well as in the public policy domain. And it is particularly relevant for central bankers, who have shouldered large part of the responsibility to navigate the economy through a once-in-a-generation financial and economic crisis. In the first part of my remarks today I will contour some salient features of central banks' response to the crisis. But I am sure that everyone here today is more interested in the future than pondering on what has been done so far. Indeed, as the macroeconomic and business environment remains challenging, the calls for a rethinking of business models and strategic orientations become more forceful. This is also the case in the monetary policy-making arena, where new strategic aspects are being promoted and debated around the globe. In the second and main part of my remarks I would, therefore, like to focus on two examples of such \\\"innovative\\\" strategic thinking for monetary policy, assessing them from a euro area perspective. The first example concerns the objective of monetary policy. The second one refers to how policy is conducted to deliver the assigned objective. Prompted by the crisis, central bankers globally have thought openly and creatively. They designed and deployed a host of measures that went well beyond their traditional modus operandi. This reaction of central banks has clear parallels to the way business leaders confront challenges. To illustrate this, let me briefly outline how features of central banking practices correspond to the four themes that the organisers of this conference have laid out as relevant for addressing challenges in the corporate world. The first theme is strength. Central banks typically rely on financial markets to transmit their monetary policy intentions to the real economy. During the crisis, dysfunctional segments of financial markets threatened to weaken or completely suppress this process. Central banks addressed these market dislocations in a resolute way, thereby showcasing the strength of the instruments that are at their disposal. Second comes control. Ensuring that the expectations of firms and households regarding future inflation remain well-anchored is of the essence for keeping inflation in check. During the crisis, through words and deeds, central banks have strived to maintain these expectations under control. The third theme is horizon. The most obvious concept of horizon in the context of central banking is that of time-horizon. Both in normal times and in times of crisis, central bankers seek to maintain a medium-term horizon and thus avoid being overwhelmed by short-term considerations. At the same time, central banks have demonstrated a capacity to deploy crisis management measures within a very short time span, when this was necessary. The fourth and final theme of the conference was courage. Again this may sound paradoxical. Central bankers are proverbially prudent and risk averse. But there is a particular type of courage that they need to exhibit: the courage and firm character to stay the course and unwaveringly pursue the assigned mandate, when calls to serve other objectives can be increasingly loud. At the ECB, in particular, our response to the crisis has been two-pronged. The first element has been the swift reduction of our key policy rates to historically low levels in response to the emergence of downside risks to price stability. This is what is considered \\\"standard\\\" monetary policy action. The second element has entailed a host of measures to address dislocations in financial markets that were preventing the permissive monetary policy interest rates to be fully and evenly reflected in the lending conditions faced by households and firms across the euro area. These measures are typically referred to as \\\"non-standard\\\" and were intended to relieve liquidity and funding constraints in the banking sector, as well as unwarranted tail risks. This set of measures, therefore, serves to improve financing conditions over and above what can be achieved through reductions in the key ECB interest rates. In addressing the crisis we have been acutely aware of the need to strike a delicate balance between two sets of competing considerations. On the one hand, central banks were faced with the risk of a financial meltdown, which would have had profound implications for the real economy and which posed a serious threat to price stability. On the other hand, the resolute response of the central bank to the financial crisis relieves the pressure from other actors in the economy to measure up to their own responsibilities, correct the past unsustainable economic course and unwind excesses. This refers not only to governments but also to the private sector. In the past year we have seen significant progress in the European economic governance framework. These changes to the institutional architecture of the EU have been of great importance for restoring the appropriate incentives of the actors involved. Let me now turn to the discussion of \\\"innovative\\\" ideas on strategic aspects of monetary policy. Since the early 1980s, a broad consensus has emerged across advanced economies which has elevated price stability to the main - although not always the sole - objective of monetary policy. Indeed, through the fixed-exchange-rate policy for the krone vis-\\u00e0-vis the euro, Danmarks Nationalbank is effectively also among the central banks aiming at maintaining price stability. In most cases, the mandate for pursuing price stability has been operationalised by defining a numerical value for inflation that the central bank should aim to deliver. In advanced economies this value is low, typically within a narrow range around $2 \\\\%$. In the wake of the crisis, however, a number of pundits have called for an increase in the inflation rate that central banks should aim for. These calls have originated from diverse sources spanning academia, policy circles and financial markets. Proponents of this The rationale is that a higher inflation objective, if credible, would prompt firms and households to revise their expectations regarding future inflation upwards. By doing so, it would reduce further down real interest rates, which are not necessarily constrained by zero. As real - rather than nominal - interest rates matter for economic decisions such as investment and consumption, this change should promote economic activity. It is therefore argued that switching to a higher numerical aim for inflation will bring about a one-off accommodative effect when it is adopted. Moreover, it is claimed that it will also make it less likely in the future that nominal rates will become constrained by their lower bound. It may not surprise you to hear that I am very sceptical about this proposal, both in general terms and in the euro area context in particular. To explain my concerns, I shall step back for a moment and clarify an aspect of the ECB's monetary policy framework that is subtle, but in my view important. By contrast to many central banks around the world, the ECB does not practice inflation targeting. The ECB has been mandated by the Treaty (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) to maintain price stability over the medium term. The mandate itself does not entail a precise definition of what price stability means in practice. The Governing Council, therefore, decided to identify inflation values consistent with conditions of price stability. Price stability conditions do not necessarily entail stable prices, that is to say zero inflation. Inflation levels which are sufficiently contained to not interfere with economic choices are to be considered indicative of a stable monetary environment, and therefore of price stability. Inflation impinges on a large array of economic activities. For instance, it has an important effect on the way people take decisions about how to allocate resources across time. For example, a household's decision to consume today or instead save and consume in the future; a worker's decision to supply labour; or a firm's decision to invest. Moreover, inflation - especially if it is volatile - creates distortions in the information content of relative prices in the economy. This can lead to incorrect economic decisions if, for instance, firms wrongly interpret a general price increase as a signal of increased demand for their product. It also affects the frequency of changes in businesses' price tags and menus. Importantly, these effects lead to dead-weight losses and distortions in the allocation of resources and, therefore, to socially sub-optimal economic outcomes. The upshot is that the rate of inflation, above which distortions of economic decision-making start becoming material, is not a matter of policy preference, like an inflation target. Instead, it is a structural feature of the economy. It is linked to aspects such as contract and commercial pricing technologies; the tax and welfare system; and the demographic structure of the population, to name but a few. While these structural features of course can and indeed do change, they do so only very gradually and infrequently. Moreover, the direction and size of the effect of any such changes on the non-distortive inflation rate is not a priori clear. It needs to be thoroughly examined and conclusively proven. For surveys of the literature on the costs of inflation, see O. Issing, \\\"Why price stability?\\\", in: A.G. Herrero, V. Gaspar, L. Hoogduin, J. Morgan and B. Winkler (eds.), Why price stability?, First ECB Central Banking Conference, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2001 and G. Camba-Mendez, J.A. Garcia and D. Rodriguez Palenzuela, \\\"Relevant economic issues concerning the optimal rate of inflation\\\", in O. Issing (ed.), Background studies for the ECB's Evaluation of its Monetary Policy Strategy, European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2003. Where does this leave us on the proposal to increase the numerical objective pursued by monetary policy? An inflation target can be changed to reflect shifting policy tastes and moving priorities. But a quantitative definition of price stability is a range of inflation values that can be qualified as unproblematic for economic decision-making. And this qualification is a factual statement, not a matter of tactical choice. Changing it on tactical grounds would be opportunistic and would harm the credibility of the central bank. For a central bank like the ECB, wedded to a range of inflation values that can be characterised as indicative of stable prices, a change to this range - and notably to its upper quantitative limit - is not conceivable barring analysis that convincingly argues for a wider range and larger values. A change not justified on these bases would create permanent damage to our ability to steer inflation expectations and contain inflation volatility. A loss of credibility can lead to an overshooting of inflation expectations. This would require a disproportionate withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation in the future to rein in inflation. Any initial boost to economic activity will therefore ultimately be more than reversed. Additional and unnecessary volatility in real activity would be the price to pay. In any case, it seems to me that the trade-off implied by this proposal is rather lopsided. Even if the central bank is successful in engineering precisely the intended permissive conditions as measured by a real interest rate decline, it is far from clear that this would indeed generate real effects even in the short-term. If, for instance, there are quantitative constraints in the availability of credit at play in the economy, the lower short-term real rates will fail to stimulate aggregate demand. Overall, therefore, one risks trading very uncertain gains - in terms of immediate policy accommodation - against rather certain costs - in terms of higher inflation, possibly for an indefinite period. Such risk-payoff structures are perfectly acceptable in the business world. Indeed taking calculated risks is often the mark of a successful business leader. For public policy, however, this strikes me as a deal that should not be made. But for some of the proponents of increasing the central bank's inflation objective this proposal is not motivated by a perceived need to stimulate aggregate demand when nominal interest rates are at zero or close to zero. Instead, they focus on another feature of the crisis: balance sheet adjustment in order to address the over-indebtedness problem. According to this argument, a higher inflation objective makes it less likely that the economy may get trapped in a destructive debt-deflation spiral of the type described by Irving Fisher. In the midst of the Great Depression, Fisher put forward a theory of economic crises that centred on the mutually reinforcing effects between over-indebtedness and deflation. According to this view, over-indebtedness beyond some point triggers distressed asset sales as debt is called in. This leads to abrupt deleveraging and a contraction of the amount of money in circulation. The destruction of money precipitates a fall in the general price level. Deflation in turn causes the real debt and interest burden to go up, thereby triggering a new bout of distressed asset sales and deleveraging and trapping the economy in a vicious circle. Deflation poses risks to the economy that - in some respects - are even more intractable than inflation. It is for this reason that the Governing Council's definition of price stability rules out negative inflation values. Moreover, the Governing Council's policy aim (within the range of positive inflation rates that are consistent with price stability) is sufficiently close to the upper bound of the range to stave off the risk that negative price shocks may unleash a self-reinforcing downward inflation spiral. But engineering financial repression in order to facilitate balance sheet adjustment would clearly violate the mandate to maintain price stability as a primary objective conferred upon the ECB by the Treaty. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the central bank's steering of inflation expectations as an illustration of the notion of control. Moreover, I mentioned that the steadfast pursuit of the central bank's mandate exemplifies the notion of courage. I am very sceptical whether increasing the numerical definition of price stability helps in either of these dimensions. Let me now turn to the second example of an innovative proposal for monetary policy that I would like to discuss today. Unlike the previous proposal, this one does not relate to the objective of the central bank. Instead, it focuses on how the central bank can actually achieve its assigned objective, when the chances that the objective will be hit diminish. As I already mentioned, central banks typically conduct monetary policy by steering nominal short-term interest rates. These are the rates over which they can exert significant influence through the monopoly supply of central bank reserves. It is, however, widely accepted that it is primarily long-term interest rates that matter for the main economic decisions that the central bank wants to influence. How is it then that monetary policy can have an impact on the economy? Well, one can think of long-term interest rates as comprising two elements: expectations regarding the future evolution of short-term rates; and premia. Premia relate to the compensation investors demand for holding on to an asset for a specific period of time (the term premium). Moreover, they relate to the compensation for risks, such as the possibility of incurring capital losses due to difficulties they may encounter when selling the asset back to the market before maturity and at short notice (the liquidity premium). Changes in the current policy rate are typically interpreted by markets to also signal changes for short-term rates in the future. That is, they affect market expectations for future short-term rates and therefore, long-term rates. In normal times, this signalling channel works well and market expectations tend to be in line with monetary policy makers' intended long-term rates. When, however, short-term nominal rates are at zero or close to zero, this signalling channel loses its potency. The risk is that long-term rates may drift away from the central bank's intended path, in which case financing conditions in the economy will not properly reflect the stance of monetary policy. Some academic economists have advocated that, particularly in such a situation, the central bank should engage in active communication regarding the future path of policy rates. If this commitment is sufficiently credible, it will be effective in steering expectations regarding future interest rates and so influence the first component of long-term interest rates to which I was referring before. This is turn, will allow the central bank to deliver accommodative financing conditions in the economy over a certain horizon. A number of central banks around the world - most recently including the US Federal Reserve - have adopted some version of this approach. But the decomposition of long-term rates I mentioned a few moments ago suggests that there is also another possible way for the central bank to deliver appropriate financing conditions in the economy. This second approach is to exert influence on the premia, to the extent that they are unwarranted and reflect dislocations in markets. I would argue that the assessment regarding which approach is more appropriate depends on the particular situation each monetary policy maker faces. The approach focusing on communication regarding the future path of short-term interest rates is in principle applicable to a situation where there is a need to provide general, across the board, stimulus to the economy. Moreover, it applies in currency areas where financing conditions are more or less homogeneous throughout segments of the financial market and of the currency space. By this I mean a situation in which following a reduction in the array of risk-free interest rates, firms or households with comparable characteristics experience a broadly similar decrease in the borrowing rates they are charged for finance. Despite the notable improvements recently, this by and large is not the situation we are facing in the euro area. Domestic financial conditions across euro area countries remain fragmented. The spreads that lenders apply over benchmark rates are very uneven and, in some countries, abnormally high, reflecting dysfunctional market dynamics. Moreover, there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate in the euro area. Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. Under these circumstances, it strikes me as far more appropriate to encourage conditions for a more even distribution of the very permissive liquidity provision that is in place. Engaging in promises regarding the future monetary policy stance would not be the most effective instrument for achieving this. Instead, we need to continue addressing the part of the premia in long-term rates in the euro area that is not warranted. But let me be clear, this does not mean that monetary policy instruments should be used to reduce credit spreads that reflect well-founded concerns regarding long-term debt sustainability and competitiveness. Is this alternative approach effective? In a nutshell I would say that the arsenal of the ECB's instruments for monetary policy implementation continues to be able to induce relaxation of conditions in term borrowing, when this is deemed necessary. In particular, the very long tenor of some of our refinancing operations combined with the full accommodation of banks' demand for such refinancing at the prevailing rate has proven to be very powerful. Indeed, this has been effective in lowering rates along the yield curve, without having to engage in commitments on the future stance of monetary policy to steer expectations. By providing security to our bank counterparties that central bank credit will remain in place for a sufficiently long horizon, we have acted on the liquidity premium component of term interest rates: the spread that remunerates banks lending in the inter-bank market for the risk that their borrowing counterpart may become illiquid and unable to honour the inter-bank credit contract at maturity. This added degree of comfort has encouraged market activity at decreasing term lending rates. But I do not want to imply that the approach that the ECB has followed thus far is free of pitfalls. For instance, the use of refinancing operations with a very long maturity results in an immediate expansion of the balance sheet when implemented. Such an expansion is not without challenges for central bank communication and for managing inflation expectations. Moreover, it has the unintended side-effect that it increases the encumbrance of banks' balance sheets. That is, it increases the share of bank assets that are already pledged as collateral, and thus unavailable to support the borrower's standing in additional credit operations. The share of bank assets that would be available to cover the claims of unsecured creditors in case of a default shrinks. This, in turn, amplifies the perceived loss given default of additional claimants and makes it more difficult for banks to access the unsecured money markets, which in normal times is the main market for marginal bank funding. We are fully aware of this risk and this is part of the reason that we have allowed for early repayment of our 3-year long-term refinancing operations. This way, when a counterparty judges that its chances of accessing market funding are being constrained by its use of ECB 3-year long-term refinancing operations, it can repay all or part of the amount borrowed earlier than its original maturity. In fact, tomorrow is the first opportunity to make use of the early repayment option. Euro area banks have taken this opportunity and have informed us that they will repay $\\u20ac 137$ billion of the slightly more than $\\u20ac 1$ trillion outstanding in such long-term operations. We will exert vigilance to ensure that - notwithstanding the legitimate decisions of individual banks to reduce their liabilities to the central bank - the overall liquidity conditions prevailing in the money market will remain consistent with the degree of accommodation that the current outlook for prices and real activity warrant. Whichever of the two approaches a central bank decides to use, it needs to be well appreciated that there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve. Delivering accommodative financing conditions and ample liquidity to the banking system has been necessary to avoid an abrupt deleveraging that could tip the economy into a destructive deflationary spiral. But parts of the banking system remain overstretched and this needs to be addressed in order to move decisively out of the crisis. Similarly, structural reforms need to be undertaken in order to restore the competitiveness of euro area economies. Only such reforms can deliver a lasting reversal of the fragmentation phenomena that the euro area has witnessed. And clearly neither of these tasks can be taken up by monetary policy. Let me conclude with a cautionary tale. Innovation is the quintessence of entrepreneurship and a cornerstone for economic growth and prosperity in market-based economies. But there can be innovations that create more problems than the ones they were originally conceived to address. I am reminded of the two mortal sins of economic policy-making that clearly transpire when reading Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's excellent book on financial crises: arrogance and ignorance. Transposing this insight to the discussion on monetary policy frameworks, I would say that it is dangerously arrogant to believe that one's current approach to monetary policy is perfect and no improvements or changes will ever be needed. Certainly, before the crisis, a certain degree of academic group thinking and central bank professional hubris bred a sense of accomplishment that proved exceedingly complacent and ultimately self-defeating. Looking forward, we should temper a tendency to self-complacency - if not arrogance - with the strength of thought and the courage of vision. But courage and vision should not entice us into hazardous experimentations. We should not be ignorant of the lessons that history has taught. And history has shown that inflation was permanently brought under control when the public's inflation expectations became safely anchored. This in turn occurred when central banks gained credibility regarding their determination to stabilise inflation. This credibility was hard-earned but can be eroded easily. It would be irresponsible to jeopardise it. As regards the ECB in particular, I am convinced that our existing monetary policy framework provides enough scope for instruments to continue addressing the crisis in a decisive and effective way. We remain attentive to possible shortcomings in our policy framework and to changes in the structure of the economy that would warrant revisiting aspects of this framework. At present, however, I see no compelling case for change. Thank you very much for your attention.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cut\",\n          \"rise\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
